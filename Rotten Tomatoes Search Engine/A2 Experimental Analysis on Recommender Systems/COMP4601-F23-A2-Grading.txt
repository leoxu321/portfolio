Implementation (35 marks):
Have you implemented both item-based and user-based recommendations?
Have you supported both top-k and threshold neighbour selection?


Overall Code Quality (15 marks):
What is you overall implementation quality (code organization, efficiency, scalability, etc.)?

Report (50 marks):
What was the overall depth and quality of the experimental analysis and the report? It is expected that a solid search through the parameter space (combinations of algorithms, top-k/threshold, and parameter values) has been performed. There should also be a detailed analysis and discussion to conclude which solution would be the best choice for a real-time online movie recommendation system (e.g., looking at runtime or number of neighbours being considered in the best MAE cases). Further analysis of other aspects of the data (average number of neighbours being used, regardless of top-k/threshold value, etc.) would also be ideal. The report should be of high quality, with meaningful insight and analysis of the results that have found and figures to graphically present key data. You should aim to make it clear that you have an in-depth understanding of the different algorithms we have covered, as well as their drawbacks/advantages given the specific problem dataset.
