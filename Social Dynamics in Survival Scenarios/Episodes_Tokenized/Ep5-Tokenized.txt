0.00 42.42 HOST: Two uninhabited Pacific Islands, more than 5,000 miles from the UK. One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British women. For six weeks they'll be utterly alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools. Filming everything themselves. When pushed to the limits of human endurance, will it be brute power, or mental strength that wins the day?
43.42 45.42 DAN:  They're too cute, I can't.
45.42 52.42 HOST: Who will have what it takes to stay alive? Tonight we follow the men's island.
53.42 60.42 SPEAKER_16  It's a scorpion, guys. It will be harder than ever. They'll have to endure the height of
64.70 76.90 HOST: a harsh tropical storm season. Bit like being in a disaster film. They'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food. Watch him, watch him, go now, go now. That is amazing.
77.90 83.90 HOST: Had these modern day men got what it takes to survive?
83.90 87.90 VIC: We're all sweating our bollocks off up there, fella, and it looks like...
87.90 88.90 VIC: Yeah, yeah, sorry.
88.90 95.90 VIC: It looks like you're doing a ******* call when it comes to wood.
99.90 104.90 HOST: Two weeks ago, 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific island.
105.90 108.90 VIC: Whoo! That was the dumbest thing I ever did!
108.90 110.90 HOST: But now three of the men have quit.
110.90 113.90 HOST: Now that that way is ******* off, let's get on with it.
113.90 117.90 HOST: And the island has taken its toll on the 11 that remain.
118.90 121.90 HOST: I genuinely, I've never been so terrified in my life.
121.90 123.90 HOST: Did you finally see a wife?
123.90 129.90 HOST: Having barely found anything substantial to eat, they're now on the brink of starvation.
129.90 133.90 VIC: We ain't conquered *******. Nothing.

(INTRO)

134.90 141.90 PHIL: It's a bit like being in a disaster film or, you know, or when you're here on the news that people have had a typhoon coming.
141.90 158.90 PHIL: It's a bit like being in a disaster film or, you know, or when you're here on the news that people have had a typhoon coming.
158.90 165.90 PHIL: When you're here on the news that people have had a typhoon coming through or a flood.
165.90 170.90 PHIL: There's no water, there's no electricity, there's no food supply.
170.90 175.90 PHIL: Sometimes out here can feel like you've been hit by a major disaster.

184.90 186.90 VIC: Oh, look, another day in paradise.

189.90 193.90 HOST: It's been 15 days since the men arrived on the island.
196.90 201.90 HOST: And so far, they have survived on a meagre diet of a few hundred calories a day.

203.90 209.90 CHARLIE: So thin now, but ribs, all sorts of bones appearing.
209.90 212.90 CHARLIE: I haven't seen since I was a bloody teenager.
214.90 215.90 CHARLIE: Oh, hang on.
216.90 218.90 CHARLIE: Oh, hang on.
219.90 221.90 PIERS: Slide down, mate.
222.90 234.90 CHARLIE: Oh, it's the nearest I've got to fainting or I see him as fainting, having never fainted before, but my vision just went pulsating in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out.
234.90 236.90 CHARLIE: And then before I knew it, I was on my arse.
237.90 239.90 CHARLIE:  So the semi collapsed.

245.90 248.90 ROSS:  We're surviving off of limpets and like the odd one fish.
249.90 252.90 ROSS:  It's not going to sustain us for the next god power weeks.
252.90 257.90 ROSS:  I think another week of this, but we're struggling massively just to even get up in the morning.
257.90 265.90 ROSS:  We need to find a solid source of food or, you know, we could be facing meltdown.

268.90 271.90 BARNEY: We're out of food, we've got a line of we don't have any food other than limpets.
271.90 274.90 BARNEY: We're getting weaker and weaker. I certainly feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker.
274.90 279.90 BARNEY: So my priority is how about kill about personally is food.
279.90 283.90 BARNEY: I think the majority of our resources should be to getting us a good fish today.
284.90 287.90 VIC: Let's go. We are going to find lunch.
293.90 295.90 ROSS: Come on, fishy, fishy, fishy.

296.90 299.90 HOST: In a survival situation, you always face one huge dilemma.
299.90 302.90 HOST: And that is if you want to eat, you've got to hunt.
302.90 308.90 HOST: Hunting burns for energy and there's no guarantee you're actually going to catch anything at the end of it.

309.90 310.90 UNKNOWN: Any glimmers yet, Vic?
310.90 312.90 VIC: I can see fish, can you?
313.90 314.90 VIC: Bastard you.

316.90 319.90 HOST: Every time you go looking for food, you're gambling.
319.90 321.90 HOST: You're gambling with the energy reserves.
NOTE: DAN CHECKS IN ON PIERS, AND PIERS EXPRESSES HIS TIREDNESS
322.90 324.90 DAN:  You know, Piers, you can see them a bit lacking in enthusiasm.
324.90 327.90 PIERS: Oh, so that's dead on my feet.
330.90 331.90 PIERS: Actually dead on my feet.
332.90 335.90 PIERS: I feel just completely gone.

340.90 343.90 VIC: You just keep nibbling it straight off end.
344.90 346.90 VIC: The luck of the gods is not with us today.

346.90 351.90 WILL: Everyone's getting tired.

351.90 354.90 WILL: Everyone's hungry. Everyone's sick of bacon, limpets.
356.90 358.90 WILL: We need some decent food and we need it quick.
359.90 361.90 WILL: So we don't get it soon.
361.90 363.90 WILL: I'm just going to start talking about fires.

368.90 373.90 HOST: Despite the group's desperation, one man refuses to be beaten.


376.90 378.90 VIC: Let's all push it to the edge.
378.90 379.90 VIC: I feel fine.
380.90 381.90 VIC: Another day at the office.
386.90 387.90 VIC: I feel really good, yeah?


388.90 393.90 HOST: Vic wants to change tactics and take the hunt to an unexplored part of the island.
394.90 401.90 HOST: One kilometer from camp is a vast freshwater lagoon where he believes a much bigger prize could be lurking.
402.90 406.90 HOST: One that could provide the group with the calories they so desperately need.

406.90 409.90 VIC: We are going hunting for Mr. Cayman.
409.90 411.90 VIC: Let's go lay some traps fellas.
412.90 413.90 VIC: Let's go hunt some beast.



415.90 421.90 HOST: As well as the search for food, the men's survival depends on them having a constant supply of drinking water.
422.90 428.90 HOST: They need at least 30 liters a day, which they must collect on a back-breaking two kilometer round trip.

NOTE: PHIL IS NOT HAPPY WITH KYLE, AND WANTS HIM TO PICK IT UP DURING WATER RUNS

429.90 434.90 PHIL: Sam, when you go past KYLE, can you ask him to come and help do the water run, please?
438.90 439.90 PHIL: Not a shirkin is he?
439.90 443.90 PHIL: Hey, I'm just saying the water run he's doing and he's chewing his dumbs.
443.90 444.90 PHIL: You do the maths.
446.90 449.90 PHIL: Right, let's go grab Carl.
451.90 455.90 PHIL: Kyle, are those crocs going to be OK for going across to get some water?
456.90 459.90 KYLE: Is there anything else, nothing about seawater?
459.90 461.90 KYLE: I've done a lot of mileage last few days.
461.90 463.90 KYLE: I think I'd rather do something a bit more camp-based today.
464.90 467.90 KYLE: I've done water two days in a row, mate, so this is my third day, so...
467.90 469.90 PHIL: Yeah, yeah, OK, so...
469.90 471.90 KYLE: Well, we've got 11 people here.
471.90 473.90 KYLE: But they're not here now, mate.

NOTE: PHIL THANKS PIERS FOR TAKING A STEP UP TO LOOK AFTER CAMP

474.90 476.90 PIERS: KYLE, won't make the sit-in tight of the camp then.
476.90 477.90 PIERS: I'll do it.
477.90 478.90 PIERS: That's no problem, mate.
479.90 480.90 PHIL: Cheers.
481.90 482.90 PHIL: Cheers, thanks, Piers.
482.90 484.90 PHIL: Right, off we go.

488.90 491.90 KYLE: I just sat in the office in front of the screens.
491.90 499.90 KYLE: I know there's more to life than that, so I just got to a stage where I wanted to break away from it, step away from the screens and just do something different.
500.90 503.90 KYLE: I like to think I can step up to most challenges.
503.90 507.90 KYLE: I like to see myself as someone who will see things through to the end, so...
508.90 516.90 KYLE: If I was the person who was struggling in the group and was a useless 
one, that would be a big knock to my confidence. Big knock.

NOTE: PHIL IS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN KYLE (-1)

520.90 522.90 PHIL: I was a little disappointed in Kyle.
522.90 527.90 PHIL: It would have been nice if he just stepped up to the plate and said, you know what, I'll step in, but...
527.90 529.90 PHIL: He wasn't in the mood to do that today.

NOTE: VIC AND DAN ARE OUT HUNTING + ONE MORE PERSON

530.90 534.90 KYLE: It's not so much that I'm hungry. The worst thing is just the energy.
534.90 540.90 KYLE: I never for a second thought my energy would be as low as it has been.
540.90 543.90 KYLE: Fuck. I can't even lift up my legs.


550.90 552.90 DAN:  Now, keep an eye out for Mr Fucking...
552.90 554.90 DAN: See you came in our screen.
554.90 557.90 VIC: Yes. How big did they say they'd get?
558.90 559.90 DAN:  Hes not going to eat me is he?.
559.90 562.90 SAM:: Six foot came in and six metres the alligator.
562.90 564.90 VIC: Oh, his alligators? Yeah.
564.90 566.90 VIC: Fuck it.

NOTE: DAN LIKES VIC, AND LOOKS UP TO HIM, WANTS TO HAVE HIS ENERGY


568.90 571.90 DAN: I don't know if Vic gets his energy, but I need half of that energy.
571.90 575.90 DAN:  Because Vic has got energy all the way through the day.
576.90 581.90 Dan: If I could take anything away from this island, I would like to be a little bit more like Vic Fellows.
582.90 584.90 DAN:  See, like that.
584.90 586.90 DAN:  That is actual shit.
586.90 589.90 VIC: What the fuck is this Jurassic Park? That's not shit.
589.90 590.90 VIC: That's shit.
590.90 591.90 VIC: That's not shit, fellas.
591.90 594.90 VIC: That's mud out of there. Do you know what it is?
594.90 597.90 DAN:  I'm sure there's a T-Rex here. 
VIC: Oh, fuck, that's great.

NOTE: VIC AND DAN JOKE ABOUT FINDING SHIT, DAN MAKES A JOKE, AND VIC IS AMUSED

600.90 603.90 SAM:: What do you do? If you see something snapping at your feet,
603.90 610.90 VIC: what are you going to do? Are you going to machete it? Worst case scenario, if I can't pin him, I'm fighting for my life.
610.90 611.90 VIC: It's having it, isn't it? Yeah.
611.90 614.90 VIC: As best as a facilities manager can do.
614.90 623.90 VIC: HE CHUCKLES I'm 47. This could be my last crazy hurrah.
623.90 627.90 VIC: And what better way to do it than the ultimate challenge of surviving?
627.90 630.90 VIC: I mean, it's the ultimate challenge. Can I provide for me?
630.90 632.90 VIC: Andy...
633.90 635.90 VIC: Yes, I am very excited.
635.90 637.90 VIC: It's Boy Scout shit, isn't it? We're all over it.
637.90 639.90 VIC: We get knives and spears and stuff.
639.90 641.90 VIC: Maybe even a bow and an arrow to make.
641.90 643.90 VIC: I mean, how good does it get?
643.90 645.90 VIC: Excited is an understatement.
645.90 647.90 VIC: Yes, sometimes I have to keep...
647.90 651.90 VIC: WHISTLE ..put a lid on it to let it get, like, boom!
651.90 653.90 VIC: That kind of excitement. Yeah.

655.90 659.90 SAM:: Just keep quiet, keep quiet, guys, because if there is a croc, we'll see it.
659.90 661.90 VIC: Where do Caymans live?
661.90 663.90 SAM:: I don't know.
663.90 666.90 SAM:: I presume they lived in the water.
666.90 669.90 VIC: I thought they lived up trees.
669.90 671.90 VIC: Do Caymans live in holes?
671.90 673.90 SAM: I reckon Caymans live in holes.
673.90 675.90 SAM: Dear. Well, I'm making that up, but...
675.90 677.90 VIC: It sounds good, though.

NOTE: SAM: MAKES A JOKE, AND VIC IS AMUSED

680.90 682.90 VIC: Figure out something in bollocks, I'm coming out.

683.90 686.90 HOST: Crocodiles are ambush predators.
686.90 691.90 HOST: They hunt their prey in shallow waters and are masters of the stealth attack.
692.90 697.90 HOST: To raise a sharp teeth and a bite, there's three tires more powerful than the lion.

698.90 700.90 None  Shh!
700.90 702.90 VIC: Sam, shh!
702.90 704.90 VIC: That is a caiman.
704.90 706.90 VIC: Look, he's up with... Oh, fuck, he's a biggie.
706.90 708.90 VIC: Now, there is our baby.
708.90 710.90 VIC: That is dinner, yeah. That is our dinner.
710.90 712.90 VIC: Thank you.
712.90 714.90 VIC: Would it be worth swimming in?
714.90 716.90 VIC: Not for me.
716.90 718.90 VIC: I'd like swimming in that. Not a chunt.
721.90 723.90 VIC: That is insanity, yeah.
724.90 726.90 VIC: Fucking bastard.
727.90 729.90 VIC: Look, look, he's moving. He's moving.
729.90 731.90 VIC: He's got a baby ripple behind him.
731.90 733.90 VIC: Look at that size of a fucking head.
735.90 738.90 VIC: He's an inquisitive, he's like a boy, isn't he?
738.90 740.90 VIC: Come to Daddy
741.90 744.90 VIC: We now need to find him where he comes in and go out.

746.90 748.90 SAM:: OK.
749.90 751.90 SAM:: Wherever we are now... Yeah?
751.90 753.90 SAM:: ...is where they come out. 
VIC: Yep. Dead right.
753.90 755.90 SAM:: That...
755.90 757.90 SAM:: Here's where crocs come out of the water.
757.90 759.90 VIC: Yep. No, it's perfect, innit?

759.90 761.90 DAN:  I'm gonna make a snare there.
761.90 763.90 DAN:  Right towards the water.
763.90 765.90 SPEAKER_16  You ever caught anything this night before?
767.90 769.90 DAN:  Have I ever made a snare before? No.
769.90 771.90 DAN:  Shh!
NOTE: DAN AND VIC, AND SAM: ARE CONTINUING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CATCH THE CAYMAN (BOTH SAM’S ARE HERE)
771.90 773.90 VIC: He's there, he's about... He's back.
773.90 775.90 VIC: Straight through here.
775.90 777.90 VIC: Straight through here, see him?
777.90 779.90 VIC: He's got close, he's behind him.
779.90 781.90 VIC: That shifty little bastard's got closer, hasn't he?
781.90 783.90 VIC: He's not scared of us.
786.90 789.90 DAN:  You will have to keep an eye on him while I'm setting the trap.
789.90 791.90 DAN:  Shh! That's why I keep looking past you,like he keeps dropping and don't either, buggering. 

791.90 800.90 HOST: The men have had just two days' survival training, where they learned how to set basic traps.
800.90 807.90 HOST: But the reality of catching a crocodile that can measure up to 13 feet is a different matter entirely.

807.90 809.90 VIC: This is proper boy. Scow shit at this, innit?
809.90 811.90 VIC: He's gonna test it.
811.90 813.90 DAN: I'll test it. Yeah?
814.90 816.90 VIC: Oh!
816.90 818.90 VIC: Dinner is served!
818.90 820.90 DAN: That's not bad, is it?
820.90 822.90 VIC: That's all right, fellas.
822.90 824.90 VIC: That's the one. Let's go.
824.90 827.90 VIC: Back to base, yeah? 
DAN: Back to base.

829.90 836.90 HOST: Late afternoon, 58-year-old Phil is returning for the water run with the help from Dr piers.

836.90 838.90 PHIL: Watch your step.
838.90 842.90 Piers: It's a good thing we didn't carry on with the jerry camp up and down these rocks.
843.90 845.90 Piers: Whoo! And home.
846.90 849.90 HOST: While Kyle continues to rest on the beach.

850.90 852.90 BARNEY: There's a feeling amongst the campers.
852.90 855.90 BARNEY: He's not contributing as much as he should be.
856.90 860.90 BARNEY: I feel like we've just been trying to deal with the fire and do the water.
861.90 865.90 BARNEY: And Kyle's been kind of doing the feet manicuring bit.

NOTE: KYLES REPUTATION CONTINUES TO PLUMMET (PHIL HATES HIM, BARNEY TOO)
	+VIC ALSO THINKS KYLE HAS FELL OFF AFTER THE INITIAL ARRIVAL

866.90 868.90 PHIL: It's a little bit like anything in life, you know.
868.90 870.90 PHIL: You can have a rest, but do the work first.

870.90 876.90 HOST: It's been almost two weeks since Kyle ensured the group survival by starting a fire with his glasses.

876.90 878.90 VIC: Now, when Kyle first got a new...
878.90 881.90 VIC: He cracked the fire. He was absolutely brilliant.
881.90 882.90 VIC: Since then.
882.90 884.90 VIC: Might as well have got a day's graft in him.
884.90 886.90 VIC: Not a freaking day's graft in him.

887.90 890.90 FARMAR: I get the distinct impression, Vic, that you're getting a bit miffed.
890.90 895.90 VIC: I'm just getting miffed for anybody that springs into me and behind them, it's not sweating as hard as me.
895.90 898.90 VIC: Pull your thumb out your ass, you lazy bastard.

NOTE: BARNEY CONFRONTS KYLE, ABOUT NOT DOING ANYTHING BUT CLEANING HIS FEET

900.90 904.90 BARNEY: I feel like I'm kind of nearing my physical limit, and I think it's quite a common event.
904.90 907.90 BARNEY: I'll come down and you're doing your feet or you're sitting by the fire.
907.90 909.90 BARNEY: I'm going to be completely honest with you.
909.90 912.90 BARNEY: I feel that perhaps you haven't been pulling your weight in the last week or so.
912.90 913.90 BARNEY: OK.

915.90 919.90 KYLE: Today for me has been a bit of a challenge, I'm on, actually.
919.90 920.90 KYLE: I can't lie.
920.90 925.90 KYLE: I haven't been able to do as much as I thought I would be able to, and I'm not going to do much.
925.90 927.90 KYLE: I'm not going to do much.
927.90 937.90 KYLE: I'm not going to do as much as I thought I would be able to, and when you're in this situation, if you can't contribute, you feel like you're really letting the team down.

944.90 949.90 HOST: Despite the men's best efforts, it's yet another day with empty stomachs.

949.90 951.90 CAMERAMAN:  Bloody hell.
951.90 954.90 CAMERAMAN:  Boys, there's no meat on you.
954.90 956.90 CAMERAMAN: You need a bit of kick.

957.90 960.90 CAMERAMAN: Hey, look, you can see Piers' heart beating through his rib.
960.90 961.90 CAMERAMAN: Fucking hell.


965.90 973.90 PIERS: Being hungry, it really does affect your mental and your physical state.
973.90 976.90 PIERS: Every step is hard when you're hungry.
976.90 983.90 PIERS: There would be a stage where soon our bodies give up on us.
983.90 985.90 PIERS: And we're not far from that.

988.90 990.90 CAMERAMAN: How's it feeling, though?
990.90 992.90 Will: Exhausted.

999.90 1014.90 HOST: After over two weeks of near starvation, the men's situation is becoming critical. Desperate to catch a high-calorie prize, Vic and Dan have set multiple crocodile traps around the island.

1014.90 1019.90 HOST: Vic and Dan have set multiple crocodile traps around the island's freshwater lagoon.



1019.90 1020.90 VIC: Bingo.

1020.90 1023.90 HOST: But so far, they haven't caught a thing.

1023.90 1026.90 CHARLIE: By the look of it, it's unsolvable.
1026.90 1027.90 HOST: Fuck.
1027.90 1029.90 SPEAKER_14  Shit.
1029.90 1031.90 BARNEY: Nothing, I'm afraid.

1033.90 1040.90 HOST: On such an extreme, low-calorie diet, you're susceptible to infection, and your mental capacity is low.
1040.90 1044.90 HOST: If nothing changes, really, you're on borrowed time.
1047.90 1054.90 HOST: Over two weeks, with barely any food going in, the men's morning routines are anything but regular

1055.90 1060.90 KYLE: I feel like it's got to that moment where I'm probably going to need to go for a shit-soon.
1060.90 1064.90 KYLE: When it comes to options, they've got land or sea.
1064.90 1066.90 KYLE: I think I'm going to answer the sea.
1066.90 1071.90 CAMERAMAN: LAUGHTER Where are you going to go?
1071.90 1074.90 KYLE: I need to figure out, is it sort of washing that direction or...?

1081.90 1082.90 CAMERAMAN: He's going for it.
1082.90 1084.90 CAMERAMAN: Kyle's taking a dump in the sea.
1084.90 1086.90 CAMERAMAN: Good man.
1086.90 1089.90 CAMERAMAN: Yeah, the most beautiful spot in the world to get dumped in.

1091.90 1093.90 CAMERAMAN:  Have you joined the poo crew?
1093.90 1099.90 DAN:  So, I'm one for back at home, maybe a four to five shit a day, man.
1099.90 1101.90 DAN:  A day? A day.
1101.90 1103.90 DAN:  I'm pretty good, I'm very regular.
1103.90 1110.90 DAN:  And I haven't shat until half-six this morning, and now I feel enlightened.

NOTE: DAN JOKES ABOUT BEING ABOUT TO POTTY AND ROSS IS VISIBLY AMUSED

1111.90 1113.90 DAN:  I'm now part of the poo crew.

1114.90 1119.90 HOST: But 28-year-old Piers, the group's doctor, isn't having as much success.

1119.90 1121.90 ROSS: How was your...
1122.90 1124.90 PIERS: Bowels. Bowels.

NOTE: ROSS AND PIERS TALK ABOUT BOWELS, AND PIERS SHARES THAT HE IS UNABLE TO SUCCEED

1124.90 1127.90 ROSS: Yeah, any movement yet? 
1127.90 1130.90 PIERS: Being stubborn. Wow. No poo in 15 days.
1132.90 1134.90 PIERS: It'll come.

1139.90 1141.90 VIC: I'm ready. Up, and one, two, three.

1141.90 1150.90 HOST: With no food to eat, the men still have to expend their energy on vital tasks, like keeping their fire going to boil and purify the water that they collect.

NOTE: VIC, PHIL’S AND BARNEY OPINION OF KYLE CONTINUES TO PLUMMET, AS THEY SEE HIM DOING NOTHING BUT TAKE CARE OF HIS FEET STILL

1151.90 1157.90 PHIL: Hello, hello. If you want to get a nice picture of Kyle grooming himself, you're quite welcome to do that while we're all getting wood.
1157.90 1158.90 CAMERAMAN: Where's that?
1158.90 1161.90 PHIL: Just round the corner doing his toes after he's just had a swim.

1164.90 1170.90 BARNEY: Today we were supposed to all contribute getting wood and then do individual tasks, and he has done nothing.
1170.90 1174.90 BARNEY: I think my tolerance has kind of reached a bit of a limit.
1174.90 1179.90 BARNEY: If you do let it boil inside, it does become a bit of a problem when it comes to a head like it is now.

NOTE: VIC HAS HAD ENOUGH, AND GOES TO CONFRONT KYLE

1181.90 1184.90 VIC: I can't hold stuff in. I can't.
1184.90 1187.90 VIC: Listen, when everybody... And it injures me.
1187.90 1193.90 VIC: When lots of people bits and chaff and nobody seems to want us to confront it, I think, come on, boys. We're team mates.
1197.90 1198.90 VIC: Fuck it.
1202.90 1203.90 VIC: Where is he?
1204.90 1206.90 CAMERAMAN: Look at that. He's out on his arse.
1208.90 1210.90 VIC: He's ticking piss. Come on, my fucking hell.
1211.90 1212.90 VIC: Kyle!
1216.90 1217.90 VIC: Kyle.
1217.90 1218.90 KYLE: How you doing?
1218.90 1221.90 VIC: I'm busting my knackers, fella, doing wood and you're doing your feet.
1221.90 1224.90 KYLE: I'm not doing my feet. I've come out of the water.
1224.90 1225.90 VIC: Whatever. Yeah.
1225.90 1228.90 VIC: It's not just me. It just seems that I'm only one with bottles to come up and speak to you.
1228.90 1229.90 KYLE: No, that's fine.
NOTE: EVERYONE SHARES A NEGATIVE OPINION OF HIM AS MENTIONED BY VIC
1229.90 1231.90 VIC: Every fucking bitch in the morning that you're never doing woodwears.
1231.90 1235.90 VIC: We're all sweating our bollocks off up there, fella, and it looks like... KYLE: Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
1235.90 1238.90 VIC: It looks like you're doing fuck all when it comes to wood.
1238.90 1241.90 KYLE: Admittedly, I'm not getting wood now, because I've just come out of the water, because I went for a shit.
1241.90 1247.90 VIC: We're fucking pulling tree upon tree upon tree, and it does look like you're always doing your feet.
1247.90 1249.90 VIC: I won't lie to you. It does.

NOTE: KYLE’S OPINION OF VIC HAS BECOME WORSE, THINK VIC TOOK A CHEAP SHOT

1255.90 1258.90 KYLE: It was almost like a little bit of a cheap shot from Vic.
1258.90 1262.90 KYLE: He's clearly got stuff which has been bubbling under the surface.
1263.90 1272.90 KYLE: I felt like I haven't really fitted in with a group, and, you know, I've done stuff to try and change that.
1275.90 1278.90 KYLE: But sometimes it's just the group dynamics aren't for everyone.

1280.90 1283.90 DAN:  People are starting to fray around the edges.
1285.90 1289.90 DAN:  Some of them are fraying. Some of them are coming away at the seams.
1290.90 1295.90 DAN:  We seriously, seriously need to find a sustainable source of food.

1296.90 1306.90 HOST: As the men continue to physically decline, the group is becoming fractured, and if members of the group are perceived not to be pulling their weight, they can easily become alienated.
1306.90 1314.90 HOST: And then if those rifts aren't healed, it becomes a downward spiral of conflict that ultimately could destroy the men's community

1319.90 1321.90 WILL: Hello.
1325.90 1327.90 WILL: A net here. A net.
1330.90 1331.90 WILL: Oh, yeah.

WILL: Let's go sell some tea.
1357.90 1363.90 FARMAR: If we get this net in the water, then we have our best hope yet of catching fish.

1365.90 1369.90 HOST: For thousands of years, fishermen have been perfecting the art of setting their fishinets.
1370.90 1373.90 HOST: If you get it right, you unlock the ocean's larder.
1373.90 1381.90 HOST: Forget it wrong, and all they'll be doing is wasting their precious time and precious energy, two resources that they can't afford to waste.


1384.90 1386.90 WILL: That's out. Exciting times.
1386.90 1388.90 WILL: Looking out. Yeah.

1435.90 1436.90 DAN: Can you give me a number?
1436.90 1441.90 VIC: I honestly think there's something wrong with her upstairs, because she really is a nice woman.
1441.90 1442.90 DAN: How did you find such a nice woman?
1442.90 1443.90 VIC: I have no idea.
1443.90 1444.90 DAN: What have you done?
1444.90 1446.90 DAN: You must have a size of a dick and a donkey.
1446.90 1449.90 VIC: Not a club, but God bless her.
1449.90 1450.90 DAN: How did you meet your wife?
1450.90 1451.90 DAN: Don't mind me asking.
1451.90 1452.90 VIC: I went around and knocked on the door.
1452.90 1453.90 VIC: Did you?
1453.90 1454.90 VIC: I fucking did, yeah. Dead right.
1454.90 1455.90 PIERS: What did you say?
1455.90 1458.90 VIC: I saw your work today. You turned up to meet your mate.
1458.90 1460.90 VIC: Yeah, I did. I wondered if I could take you out.
1460.90 1463.90 VIC: Let me think about it. I thought, oh, the dam and she went.
1463.90 1464.90 VIC: Yeah, OK then.
1464.90 1468.90 CHARLIE: That's the whole mountain that you live on the set of Billy Elliot meets Postman Pat.

1472.90 1473.90 VIC: So, yeah, well done me.

1474.90 1475.90 ALL: Well done you.
1480.90 1485.90 ROSS: I've spotted Piers trotting along the beach, looking really happy with himself.
1485.90 1487.90 ROSS: So I think Piers might be off to try and have a...

1536.90 1537.90 HOST: Mid-afternoon.
1537.90 1541.90 HOST: After a couple of hours' rest, the men get back to work.

1541.90 1543.90 PIERS: Come on, my son, bite

1543.90 1547.90 HOST: Two weeks ago, they were dropped on the island with eight fishing hooks.
1548.90 1550.90 HOST: But now they're down to just two.

1551.90 1552.90 PIERS: Shit.
1552.90 1554.90 PIERS: Can you unsnag my line? I've caught it on the rock.
1555.90 1556.90 PHIL: Shit.
1556.90 1558.90 PIERS: Now we've lost another rod there, guys.
1558.90 1560.90 PIERS: Shit. We've lost a hook.

1561.90 1567.90 HOST: Further down the beach, oil engineer Dan and Dr Piers swim out to check the net.

1567.90 1570.90 CHARLIE: What do we think? We're limiting? There's going to be anything on there?
1570.90 1573.90 BARNEY: We've seen it. There's lots of rocks.
1573.90 1577.90 WILL: Anything, Barney? No, sadly not.
1578.90 1580.90 BARNEY: We're hoping for the nets.
1580.90 1582.90 BARNEY: So I've got to see this moment.
1590.90 1592.90 CHARLIE: Doesn't look like a trawl.
1592.90 1596.90 CHARLIE: No, I can go as far as it looks like the square root of F4.
1596.90 1597.90 WILL: What's wrong?
1603.90 1606.90 CHARLIE: It looks like we'll be going hungry for dinner.
1609.90 1611.90 BARNEY: The nets are empty, is that right?
1611.90 1612.90 BARNEY: Shit.
1616.90 1617.90 WILL: What's happening, fella?
1618.90 1619.90 DAN: This is what we caught.
1621.90 1622.90 DAN: Can't load a coral.
1622.90 1623.90 WILL:  Fuck.

1625.90 1628.90 HOST: The razor-sharp coral has destroyed the men's net.

1628.90 1630.90 WILL: No fish at all.
1634.90 1635.90 BARNEY: Shit.
1635.90 1637.90 BARNEY: We really are up Chitt's Creek, aren't we?
1637.90 1640.90 BARNEY: With no nets, one fishing hook.
1640.90 1644.90 BARNEY: The duration just went from bad to much, much worse.

1644.90 1645.90 BARNEY: What do you think, Phil?
1645.90 1646.90 PHIL: That's disastrous.
1646.90 1648.90 PHIL: That's no food for anyone.
1648.90 1650.90 PHIL: And no means to get food.

1654.90 1656.90 PIERS: Shit, we've got one hook left.
1656.90 1658.90 PIERS: We're fucked.

1658.90 1661.90 ROSS:  So we've got one hook to fish for a month.
1661.90 1663.90 ROSS:  It's pretty depressing, yeah?

1663.90 1664.90 DAN: Northern one.
1664.90 1666.90 VIC: No joy with nets.
1666.90 1668.90 VIC: Fuck, are we going to be depleted or what?

1670.90 1672.90 WILL: Disaster.
1672.90 1674.90 WILL: We're down to our last fishing hook.
1675.90 1679.90 WILL: So the onset of starvation looks upon us.

1687.90 1695.90 HOST: With morale at rock bottom, Barney, Phil and Sam Farmer head out to the lagoon for the daily check of Vic's crocodile traps.

NOTE: BARNEY, PHIL, FARMAR, CHECK VIC’S TRAPS

1697.90 1700.90 BARNEY: Chances of catching a caiman, 4%.
1706.90 1708.90 BARNEY: The caiman's definitely been here.
1708.90 1709.90 FARMAR How do you know that?
1709.90 1711.90 BARNEY: Because the trap is destroyed.
1711.90 1713.90 FARMAR: Gosh, look at that.
1714.90 1718.90 BARNEY: It's almost certainly been triggered by a caiman.
1718.90 1723.90 BARNEY: The bait's gone, the triggers occurred, and it looks like there's been a bit of a struggle.
1723.90 1725.90 BARNEY: And the rope is firmly in the water.
1725.90 1727.90 FARMAR: Well, that is incredibly encouraging in one sense.
1727.90 1728.90 BARNEY Very.
1728.90 1730.90 FARMAR:  Is there any chance that the caiman could still be on the end?
1730.90 1732.90 BARNER: There is a chance.
1732.90 1733.90 SPEAKER_16  OK.
1733.90 1734.90 BARNEY: Fuck, he is.
1734.90 1735.90 FARMAR Is it shit?
1735.90 1737.90 BARNEY: I think he's under here, isn't he?
1737.90 1738.90 BARNEY: Is that his back?
1738.90 1739.90 FARMAR: No way.
1739.90 1740.90 BARNEY: Is this his back here?
1740.90 1741.90 BARNEY: Come here.
1744.90 1746.90 BARNEY: We need to be a bit careful about this.
1746.90 1748.90 BARNEY: I can see scales on the back of that rope.
1752.90 1761.90 BARNEY: I can see there are crocodile or caiman-like scales just underneath the water.
1765.90 1766.90 BARNEY: I'm convinced.
1766.90 1767.90 BARNEY: Go and have a look.
1767.90 1769.90 BARNEY: I'm convinced he's there.
1769.90 1770.90 BARNEY: Just be careful.
1770.90 1772.90 BARNEY: Be very careful.

1773.90 1775.90 FARMAR: There's no doubt about it, the caiman's there.
1775.90 1776.90 BARNEY: Yeah.
1779.90 1782.90 FARMAR: There is a caiman in the water right next to us now.
1782.90 1787.90 BARNEY: We need to be careful, because as soon as we drag him out there, he's going to be angry.
1787.90 1789.90 FARMAR:: I cannot quite believe it.
1789.90 1791.90 BARNEY: No, I can't either.
1791.90 1793.90 BARNEY: I cannot believe it.
1795.90 1796.90 FARMAR: My heart.
1796.90 1797.90 BARNEY: Mine too.
1797.90 1800.90 BARNEY: Mine too, because he is obviously alive, right?

1803.90 1808.90 HOST: So the crocodile is the largest, it's the meatiest animal they're going to find on the island.
1808.90 1813.90 HOST: But when they're cornered or they're scared, that's when they're most likely to attack.
1813.90 1817.90 HOST: And if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, you're in trouble.

1818.90 1821.90 PHIL: The minute we disturb this, all hell will break loose.
1821.90 1823.90 BARNEY: The three of us could take him on.
1823.90 1825.90 BARNEY: I think it's sensible to go and get many more hands.
1825.90 1827.90 BARNEY: I want you to stay here. I'll run back to camp.
1827.90 1828.90 FARMAR: Yeah.
1828.90 1829.90 BARNEY: Deliver the news.
1829.90 1830.90 FARMAR: Yeah.
1830.90 1831.90 BARNEY: And we're going to pull him out of that trap.
1831.90 1833.90 FARMAR: He's going to fight like buggers.
1833.90 1834.90 BARNEY: Absolutely.
1834.90 1835.90 FARMAR Go on, buddy.
1835.90 1836.90 BARNEY Excellent, yes.

NOTE: THEY ALL AGREE ON A PLAN, SO BARNEY, PHIL, FARMAR +1, BARNEY 
GOES BACK 
	+VIC AND CHARLIE IS VISIBLY HAPPY

1841.90 1845.90 HOST: Crocodiles can remain submerged for hours before surfacing.
1846.90 1852.90 HOST: And as lagoon is their ideal habitat, it's certain to be populated by more than just one.

2536.90 2537.90 SPEAKER_00  How did it feel?
2537.90 2539.90 PIERS: It felt great, actually. Really good.
2539.90 2541.90 PIERS: I thought it was going to be really hard.
2541.90 2544.90 PIERS: I thought it was going to be like rabbit droppings stuck together.
2544.90 2546.90 SPEAKER_00  What was it like?
2546.90 2548.90 PIERS: Like a wet sausage.
2548.90 2549.90 PIERS: A wet sausage?
2549.90 2551.90 PIERS: Yeah, it was dreamy.
2551.90 2553.90 PIERS: Absolutely dream.
2553.90 2555.90 PIERS: That croc pushed it all down.
2558.90 2561.90 ROSS: Lads... crocs ready?

2561.90 2567.90 HOST: With plenty of crocodile meat still left over, Cameraman Ross serves up breakfast.

2567.90 2570.90 ROSS: Char grilled to smoky perfection.
2570.90 2572.90 CHARLIE: Oh, that's good, isn't it?
2572.90 2573.90 WILL: I think it's better.
2573.90 2575.90 WILL: I think it's better than yesterday.

2582.90 2585.90 HOST: With their bellies full, the men set about their daily chores.

2587.90 2588.90 VIC: Look at that.
2588.90 2593.90 VIC: We have done wood, and at the same time it took Kyle to get dressed.
2593.90 2595.90 VIC: Tell me that Isnt the greatest thing.
2597.90 2599.90 VIC: Team effort, boys.

2612.90 2618.90 SAM: I feel like I can just lie on this beach right now and think about nothing and do nothing and not feel guilty for the first time pretty much since we got here.

2618.90 2621.90 DAN: This is for your personal collection.
2621.90 2623.90 DAN: This is early for me.
2623.90 2624.90 DAN: I thought so, mate.
2624.90 2625.90 DAN: I thought that...
2625.90 2626.90 DAN: A bit slower?
2626.90 2627.90 DAN: I thought that.
2627.90 2628.90 DAN: A bit slower.
2628.90 2629.90 DAN: That's it.
2629.90 2630.90 DAN: That's it.
2630.90 2632.90 DAN: Oh, what?

2634.90 2635.90 PIERS: Lovely.
2635.90 2638.90 PIERS: Enjoy the idyllic tropical sunshine.
2639.90 2641.90 PIERS: I think night goes too bad after all.

2642.90 2647.90 HOST:  For the second night in a row, the men anticipate a hearty feast of crocodile meat.
2647.90 2650.90 ROSS: Is everyone fancy the last of the croc?
2650.90 2651.90 DAN: I would love a beer.

2652.90 2659.90 HOST: As well as giving the group vital calories, the sudden intake of rich food appears to have solved another of the men's problems.

2660.90 2663.90 CHARLIE: Dan, how are your ablutions this afternoon?
2666.90 2668.90 DAN: I'm done out of Trump's.
2668.90 2670.90 CHARLIE: How are your ablutions this afternoon?
2670.90 2672.90 DAN: I'm done out of Trump and the follow-through, didn't he?
2672.90 2675.90 CHARLIE: He shits himself this afternoon while he was making his bed.

NOTE: DAN SAYS HE HAD AN ACCIDENT, EVERYONE IS SHOCKED AND THINKS ITS FUNNY (+1 BOND FOR SHARING SOMETHING PERSONAL)

2675.90 2676.90 CHARLIE: He's dribbling down my legs.
2676.90 2678.90 DAN Just a little bit.
2678.90 2679.90 DAN: A little bit of boo came out.
2679.90 2681.90 DAN:  I had to squeeze my socks out, who's that bad?
2681.90 2682.90 ALL:  Oh, God.
2682.90 2684.90 DAN:  Well, you fucking asked, didn't you?

2686.90 2688.90 PIERS: Crocodile broth this evening.
2689.90 2691.90 PIERS: It's going to be superb.
2692.90 2693.90 PIERS: Come on, boys, dig in, please.

2693.90 2695.90 BARNEY: Pass it round.
2696.90 2697.90 None  How is it, Vic?
2697.90 2699.90 VIC: Oh, it's strong.
2700.90 2702.90 VIC: I think strong is a good word.
2702.90 2704.90 DAN: There is some distinct smell of poo about this.
2704.90 2706.90 DAN: It smells a bit like dog shit, doesn't it?
2706.90 2708.90 WILL: It does smell a bit suspicious, doesn't it?
2708.90 2709.90 WILL: Yeah.
2709.90 2710.90 PHIL: Shit.
2710.90 2711.90 PHIL: Oh, crikey.
2711.90 2713.90 PHIL: Phil, I've heard it.
2713.90 2715.90 PHIL: I've had two mouthfuls and that's two mouthfuls too many.
2715.90 2717.90 PHIL: I can feel the squirts coming on.
2719.90 2727.90 HOST: The 30-degree tropical heat has spoiled the remains of the crocodile, leaving the men once again with nothing to eat.
2728.90 2731.90 WILL: The final meal from our croc, it was basically rotten meat.
2731.90 2734.90 WILL: It was pretty fucking...
2736.90 2739.90 WILL: I don't want to think about it too much.
2740.90 2743.90 WILL: It was pretty much the worst thing that I've ever had in my life.
2744.90 2746.90 WILL: Oh, oh, dear.
2748.90 2750.90 DAN: In your shoulder, please.
2751.90 2755.90 ROSS:  Well, tonight marked the ends of our crocodile feast.
2755.90 2757.90 ROSS:  From now on, we've got no more meat to eat.
2757.90 2762.90 ROSS:  Now that crocodile has dried up, we need another source of food, you know?
