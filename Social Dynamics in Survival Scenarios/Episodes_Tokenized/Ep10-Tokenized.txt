0.00 29.18 HOST: Two uninhabited Pacific Islands. More than 5,000 miles from the UK. One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British women. For six weeks they will be utterly alone, with only the clothes they stand up in.
30.16 33.16 HOST: And a handful of basic tools and fishing equipment.
33.16 37.16 SPEAKER_02  How many fishing lines have you hooked up before you've failed? None.
37.16 58.84 HOST: Filming everything themselves. When pushed to the limits of human endurance. Will it be brute power? One, two, three. Or mental strength that wins the day? Who will have what it takes to stay alive? Tonight we follow the men's island.
58.84 65.84 VIC: We're going to be dickers every single time. It's little old me. Unfortunately, I don't
65.84 90.84 HOST: trust you. Survival will be harder than ever. They'll have to endure the height of harsh tropical storm season. There's a death trap around here. They'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food. You bastard! Took the hook of the lot. And these modern day men got what it takes to survive. Holy shit!
100.08 104.72 HOST: Four weeks ago, 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific island.
104.72 107.92 HOST: Hey look, you can see Piers is heart feeding through his rib.
108.16 115.16 HOST: Despite their best efforts, they haven't been able to find a sustainable source of food.
115.16 122.16 HOST: We need some decent food and we need it quick. And the men are getting weaker by the day.
122.16 127.40 HOST: Exhausted. There is absolutely no food in this camp. The groups become increasingly
127.40 131.80 SPEAKER_01  fractured. You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people is physically easy and he'll
131.80 144.80 HOST: stab you in the fucking eye. So far, it's 47-year-old Vic, the island's top hunter, who's managed to save the group from starvation. When in doubt, he's sending out!

INTRO END

156.60 163.60 DAN: If I laid back a little bit further into the sun, it would feel like I was on holiday.
164.60 190.00 DAN: Apart from the fact that later on I'm going to have to walk half a mile for water, fish until we can eat, and chop a load of firewood. Potentially the shittest holiday anyone will ever go on.

191.00 208.20 HOST: The men have now been living on the island for a month. Unable to find a reliable source of food, they've had to survive on a meagre low calorie diet of limpets, coconut and the occasional fish.

208.20 223.80 CHARLIE: We are starting to starve. We're not eating enough. I mean look, I've never seen my rib case on that since I was bloody 12 or 13. I've got a bloody lollipop head. It looks the wrong size to my body. It looks completely out of place. There's nothing to me.


223.80 247.92 HOST: After four weeks on such an extreme low calorie diet, the men are actually in danger of entering what's called autophagy. And this literally means to self eat. Their bodies start to cannibalize themselves and if they don't find a sustainable food source for the long term, their physical condition won't just be in decline, it’ll be in free fall.

250.56 252.16 DAN: We're starting with Charlie, what are you doing?
252.16 253.16 CHARLIE: I'm building.
253.16 253.66 DAN: Phil?
253.66 257.16 PHIL:  I've been watering wood and then chipping in for whatever needs to do.
257.16 259.52 DAN: Good man.
259.52 266.76 HOST: For the exhausted men, the morning meeting has become a vital way of sharing out their daily chores.
266.76 267.76 SAM: Trapping assistant.
267.76 268.76 DAN: Good man, 
268.76 272.76 VIC: Vics going to do water wood and help anybody else doing whatever they need doing.
272.76 273.72 DAN: FARMAR?
273.72 285.76 FARMAR: The hunting is the thing that I'm probably the most excited by. For a personal level, I don't think I've quite achieved my personal ambition yet. My personal ambition would be to catch a vulture or something like that.
285.76 287.76 DAN: It's a lot of effort to do, isn't it?
287.76 289.76 VIC:  So will you be doing wood then?
289.76 291.76 FARMAR: Well, when I get back, I can do wood.
291.76 294.76 VIC:  You've got a master skill at avoiding that wood job, haven't you?
294.76 301.76 VIC: If you don't bust a gut getting wood, we're going to run out and everybody's going to know you were on wood, you were a lazy bastard.

301.76 306.76 HOST: The group has given FARMAR his orders for the day, but he's not convinced.

306.76 318.76 FARMAR: Collecting firewood is important, and I'll do my bit, definitely. But I'd love to do a bit more hunting. And, you know, it's that man against beast thing that I really enjoy.

323.76 325.76 DAN: Yeah, this is not dangerous.
327.76 335.76 HOST: With around 30 litres of water and up to 50 kilos of firewood to collect, the men have a grueling morning ahead of them.

335.76 338.76 CHARLIE This wood is ridiculous.

ROSS VIC AND PHIL HUG

339.76 342.76 VIC: Go on, man. Go on.

353.76 361.76 HOST: Against the express wishes of the group, FARMAR has decided to spend the morning bird-trapping instead of chopping wood.
365.76 375.76 FARMAR: It's quite exciting. So I'm under a little hide. Not the best hide in the world, but a hide. And I've got this little cord here.
376.76 383.76 FARMAR: And hopefully the vulture's going to come down, grab the meat, and I'll pull this rope.
383.76 386.76 FARMAR: It'll be in business. Let's just wait and see.

387.76 404.76 FARMAR: I work on foreign news stories. The problem with news is you always go to some of the nastiest places in the world. I have been shot at. I've had a near kidnapping, but I try to avoid those sort of things as best I can.
404.76 420.76 FARMAR: I'm aware that I'm incredibly privileged. You know, I haven't met the Queen, but I have had an amazing opportunity to meet people from every different sphere of life. I would hope that I'm not prejudiced. I do have opinions, but I've got a bit of grace to me.

431.76 437.76 FARMAR: Dan, I'm hiding for a vulture. And you're slightly spoiling it.
437.76 441.76 DAN: Where are you?
FARMAR: I'm hiding here, ready for a vulture.
441.76 459.76 DAN: Oh, for fuck's sake. 

DAN: The whole point of the morning meeting is to dedicate tasks. If he's got a task, he needs complete tasks before he moves up to something else. Softly, softly, he's not working anymore, so we just need to be a bit more firm with people, I think. ABOUT FARMAR


460.76 463.76 DAN: FARMAR, we need to stick to our tasks, otherwise we're not going to get shit done.
463.76 466.76 DAN: It's nearly 11 o'clock and you haven't done any wood today.
466.76 469.76 FARMAR: I'm heading there now. I'm doing coconut for the... I'm doing traps as well.
469.76 477.76 DAN: But you're not doing traps. We're doing traps. You're not doing traps, are you? Do you just concentrate on what you're supposed to be doing? If you've got a task, stick to it, complete it, finish it.
477.76 479.76 FARMAR: FINE
DAN:. Good.

481.76 492.76 VIC: I don't know. I don't know. Bloke talks a good nice posh game, but failing to deliver in my book, an island where my new graft is king. We all have to work and swear. About FARMAR
492.76 495.76 VIC No, it's not. He ain't done jack shit.

500.76 502.76 BARNEY: Shall I drop this in, then, me old fruit?
502.76 508.76 HOST: FARMAR’S reluctance to fall in with the others is starting to affect his reputation in the group.
509.76 515.76 SAM: I've given up trying to second-guess Farmer. He's his own man. He sort of exists in another world.
515.76 517.76 BARNEY Yeah. He's an airhead, isn't he? About FARMAR
517.76 519.76 SAM:  Yes. Yeah, yeah.
519.76 522.76 SAM: Vultures. 
BARNEY: Exactly. I must get a bird trap.
523.76 526.76 BARNEY: I think everyone feels like traps are a waste of time.

529.76 532.76 ROSS: There's a bit of selfishness there. I don't think...
532.76 535.76 DAN: But I don't think it means to be selfish. I just think that's why he's been brought up.
535.76 544.76 WILL: No. For me, and this is my opinion, if it is something that FARMAR wants to do, you'll work fucking hard for it. Agreed. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
544.76 554.76 CHARLIE:  I just think he's had his arse wiped for him for most of his life, and as a result, he doesn't realise when he's possibly not mucking in as much as he could do with others.

555.76 569.76 ROSS: A lot of the guys here are kind of like, I do hard graft, I come from this place, I don't come from that, and their posh voice, and the fact that they went to eaton, I think some guys here just don't relate to him very well.

570.76 583.76 HOST: As the men continue to fizzily decline, the group is becoming fractured, and it's as if they're judging each other not only on their ability to contribute and find food, but also on class prejudices, and that's coming to be a big deal.
IMPORTANT
584.76 587.76 HOST: The men are on the way to the fort.
590.76 594.76 HOST: An hour before nightfall, a tropical storm hits the island.

594.76 597.76 WILL: It’s going to rain. Yeah. He's coming in.
597.76 600.76 WILL: Guys, he's going to rain.
KYLE: YEAH
600.76 603.76 DAN: When it rains, it rains fast, it rains hard.
603.76 606.76 WILL:  Dude, I stop doing that, look after the fire for me.
606.76 611.76 HOST: The men have just minutes to secure the camp before it's washed away.
611.76 614.76 WILL: How's the fire, Sam? 
SAM: Just needs some dry kindling.
617.76 619.76 WILL: Desperately  needs to protect the firewood.
619.76 622.76 WILL Without the firewood, it's screwed.
623.76 625.76 SAM:  Oh, OK.
626.76 628.76 WILL: It's a death chuck round here.

630.76 633.76 FARMAR Come on, guys, lickety split
635.76 641.76 FARMAR: It's amazing because it's pouring of rain, and under those trees it sort of feels quite dark and kind of panicky.

641.76 645.76 VIC: Now go and get over it, get over it. Don't stop, don't stop

645.76 653.76 FARMAR And you come out here onto the beach, there's an incredible sunset over there, and it's just glistening on the water, the sun's just glistening on the water.
654.76 656.76 FARMAR:  And it just feels really quite peaceful, actually.
656.76 658.76 FARMAR:  Really quite a peaceful moment.

658.76 662.76 SAM: Splits and bamboo, and we can make a drain pipe to carry it down to the beach.
663.76 665.76 CHARLIE: Heavens absolutely opened.
665.76 668.76 CHARLIE: Enough to wash out the entire camp.
668.76 670.76 CHARLIE: All hands to the deck.
672.76 676.76 CHARLIE: There are certain times when some people need to pull their finger out and start working. 
FARMAR WAS ENJOYING THE SUNSET WHILE THEY SCRAMBLED TO SAVE THE CAMP
679.76 681.76 VIC: Ooh!
681.76 684.76 VIC: I have had some monster fucking bogies off this island.
684.76 685.76 DAN Bogies?
685.76 686.76 VIC: Monsters.
686.76 687.76 VIC: Yeah.
687.76 690.76 VIC: That must be one of the biggest bogies I've ever had in my life.
690.76 691.76 VIC: Eat it.
691.76 693.76 DAN: You dirty bastards.
694.76 696.76 VIC: I mean, you're quite welcome to it, fella, if you want it.
696.76 698.76 DAN: I'm absolutely fine, thanks, V. I'm not that hungry yet, mate.
698.76 700.76 VIC: Very tasty.

701.76 706.76 HOST: After last night's vicious storm, the men's shelter is in urgent need of repair.
708.76 710.76 DAN: You look like a shire horse.
711.76 713.76 PIERS: I see that might work, yeah.
713.76 715.76 PIERS: That one never changes.
715.76 720.76 HOST: Piers Dan and Sam Farmer have been assigned the job of weaving new palms for the roof.
720.76 722.76 DAN: That looks pretty good.
722.76 723.76 CHARLIE: That's not right.
723.76 724.76 DAN: Is it not.
724.76 726.76 CHARLIE: You're bending in the wrong way to start with.
727.76 729.76 HOST: But FARMARS struggling.

733.76 735.76 FARMAR: It's hard work, isn't it?
736.76 737.76 FARMAR: VIC.
737.76 738.76 VIC: Yes, sir.
738.76 742.76 FARMAR: I don't want to abandon my duty, but I'm actually really crap at this weaving.
742.76 745.76 DAN: No-one's good at it. Everyone shitters each other.
745.76 749.76 FARMAR: I can't actually get to work, though. I spent 45 minutes past it, and I'm obviously doing the same thing wrong.
749.76 752.76 DAN: You need a lot more determination, Sam. Just crack on with it, just stay with it.
752.76 755.76 FARMAR: I've got to pay to my strengths, and one of my strengths isn't flat-in.
756.76 757.76 DAN: But fucking stick with it.
760.76 763.76 DAN: You need to sort it out, to man to fuck up
763.76 765.76 FARMAR: Anyone fishing now?
765.76 766.76 VIC: Too rough.

769.76 771.76 ROSS Farmer is...
772.76 778.76 ROSS: ...shirking some of the harder tasks, and it's been noticed by a lot of members of the group.

780.76 783.76 SAM: I think some people in this group are working harder than others.
784.76 786.76 SAM: I don't want to point any fingers, but… Points at FARMAR
787.76 788.76 WILL: FARMAR
789.76 791.76 SAM: I do have a bit of an issue with  Farmer at the minute, yeah.
791.76 793.76 SAM: He's getting under my skin.
793.76 797.76 SAM: It just seems to potter about the places if he's looking for his butler.

798.76 804.76 HOST: Sensing the group of starting to turn against him, Sam decides to approach one of his critics.

805.76 814.76 FARMAR I hate tension, and when you can feel that someone's not quite at ease with you, I think it's worth nipping things in the bud early.

814.76 816.76 FARMAR: Sam, can I have a quick word?
816.76 820.76 FARMAR: I feel that you're a bit frustrated with me, and I don't want to make a big deal.
820.76 821.76 SAM: A little bit, man. I am.
821.76 822.76 FARMARL: What, why?
822.76 824.76 SAM: Can we talk about it later? I'm busy.
824.76 827.76 SAM: Actually, let's talk about it later, OK? I'm working.
827.76 829.76 SAM: There'll be plenty of time, OK?
829.76 832.76 FARMAR: I'd rather talk about it now, because it's in the air, and I've got a few pieces I mentioned to me.
833.76 835.76 SAM: Not now, OK?
835.76 838.76 SAM: Not now. Please, let me finish this.
838.76 840.76 SAM: Later on, we're having some food. 
FARMAR: Five minutes? 
SAM: No.
840.76 842.76 SAM: Let me get this tree down and maybe, OK?

844.76 846.76 FARMAR: Highly successful (Sarcasm)
848.76 850.76 FARMAR: Don't mind. Hes not happy.

WIll does not find fault with FARMAR, thinks he's okay

852.76 856.76 WILL: People are having a bit of a go at Farmer, and I'm finding it a bit mean, really.
856.76 862.76 WILL: FARMAR works really, really hard, but he works really hard on things he wants to do.
862.76 865.76 WILL: He's getting a bit sidetracked in that regard.

872.76 879.76 HOST: Determined to stop the rift between FARMAR and the group getting any worse, Will takes him aside for a chat.

881.76 883.76 FARMAR: I definitely think I'm putting my weight.
883.76 887.76 WILL: But I think it could be perceived that you're doing the things that you want to do.
888.76 890.76 FARMAR: I honestly don't mind what I do.
890.76 893.76 WILL: I know, exactly. And I know that. I can see that.
893.76 898.76 WILL: If you're doing it on your own and no-one's noticing, it doesn't get any cuter.
898.76 901.76 FARMAR: How bad is the gossip, do you think?
901.76 903.76 FARMAR:: Quite bad. Yeah.
903.76 905.76 WILL: Everyone's...
907.76 910.76 WILL: Yeah, I mean, that's why were having this conversations
912.76 915.76 FARMAR: Thanks, Will. Thanks very much.

916.76 919.76 FARMAR: The last few days have been quite frustrating.
919.76 923.76 FARMAR:  Quite a bit of gossip, you know, what's FARMAR up to or what's he doing?
923.76 936.76 FARMAR: And it's really hard. It's really frustrating, because I really believe, I genuinely believe, that I'm working as hard as anyone else, and I'm giving my all and I'm putting my back into this.

936.76 946.76 HOST: Wanting to explain himself to the group, FARMAR calls a meeting.

TO ALL:
946.76 949.76 FARMAR: I've actually found the last three weeks quite hard.
949.76 954.76 FARMAR: I've found the physical exhaustion that comes with a lack of food.
954.76 957.76 FARMAR: Really hard, really, really, really hard.
957.76 964.76 FARMAR: And I wanted to say thank you, really, first of all, to all you guys for being so amazing.
964.76 967.76 FARMAR: And also for bearing with me.
967.76 972.76 FARMAR: I haven't sort of almost been myself, actually, as much as I wanted to be myself.

975.76 978.76 VIC: Back in the Big Smoke, I dare say that bloke's king of the hill.
978.76 984.76 VIC: No two ways about it. How he talks, walks, conducts himself, say, great minds, fantastic, but we don't need great minds, do you?
984.76 987.76 VIC: We're cavemen. We need your sweat, blood and guts.
987.76 991.76 VIC: And if you're not, then it stands out like a blind cobblestone, doesn't it?

992.76 999.76 HOST: Determined to prove his worth to the others, Sam has decided to resurrect the group's old fishing nets.

999.76 1001.76 FARMAR: We have not bought one fish and a net yet.
1001.76 1005.76 FARMAR: If we can get these nets out, I feel that the sea is our larder.

1006.76 1012.76 HOST: But having failed with the nets several times already, the others aren't convinced by FARMAR’S latest idea.

1014.76 1018.76 ROSS: These fucking nets waste more energy than anything else.
1018.76 1024.76 ROSS: The amount of calories and energy people have expended with no return is unbelievable.
1025.76 1027.76 ROSS: It's just nuts.

1032.76 1040.76 HOST: With heavy weights and floats to get into position, FARMAR enlisted the help of Barney to set the nets.

1040.76 1042.76 FARMAR: Barney, I'm glad to hear.
1042.76 1044.76 BARNEY: Fuck!
1045.76 1048.76 BARNEY: There are a lot of rocks around here.

1048.76 1055.76 HOST: Dragging heavy fishing nets out of the sea, fighting the currents, it's going to burn through hundreds and hundreds of calories.
1056.76 1061.76 HOST: With so little energy in their body, for them it's probably going to feel like swimming through treacle.

1062.76 1064.76 FARMAR: OK, ready? One, two...
1069.76 1071.76 FARMAR Gosh, that was exhausting.
1071.76 1072.76 BARNEY: Exhausted.

1073.76 1079.76 HOST: After treading water for over an hour, Sam and Barney can finally head back to dry land.

1084.76 1085.76 FARMAR: How are you doing, lads?
1085.76 1086.76 DAN: What have you got, chaps?
1086.76 1088.76 FARMAR: Absolutely.
1089.76 1092.76 FARMAR: It was absolutely just shattering.
1092.76 1096.76 FARMAR: We really, really need to have five minutes or ten minutes to lie down.

1097.76 1099.76 VIC: It, it, do.
1099.76 1101.76 VIC: I've got some fish for you.
1101.76 1103.76 DAN: There he is.

1103.76 1110.76 HOST: The island's top fisherman, Vic, is returning to camp after another successful outing with his line and pole.

1110.76 1111.76 VIC: All right.
1111.76 1113.76 VIC: Oh, God damn, boys.
1114.76 1115.76 DAN: We've got three in a puffer.
1115.76 1116.76 VIC: I have?
1116.76 1117.76 BARNEY: Oh, my God.
1117.76 1118.76 BARNEY: You hero
1118.76 1119.76 VIC: Got you.
1119.76 1120.76 VIC:  Born and bread, kid.
1120.76 1121.76 CHARLIE: The man's a hero.
1121.76 1122.76 CHARLIE: Fat.
1122.76 1123.76 SAM: About here, champ.
1123.76 1124.76 SAM: Is that OK with you, sir?
1124.76 1125.76 VIC: Yeah.
1125.76 1127.76 SAM: Lovely. It's leaving there.
1128.76 1129.76 VIC: It's a kaboom.
1129.76 1131.76 VIC: That's what we're having.
1131.76 1132.76 VIC:  Yeah?
1132.76 1134.76 VIC:  Can I take these horrible fish off my...
1134.76 1137.76 VIC:  exceptionally good fishing pole?
1137.76 1138.76 SAM: Yeah, stick them on that.
1138.76 1139.76 VIC:  Thank you.
1140.76 1141.76 VIC: Oh, dear me.
1141.76 1142.76 VIC:  Isn't it nice feeling?
1142.76 1145.76 VIC: I know you're going to actually feel some food in your belly.
1145.76 1147.76 VIC: How's the old nets good, tiger? (SARCASM TO FARMAR)
Group exchange glances

1147.76 1154.76 DAN: It's not a great deal to go round.

1154.76 1163.76 HOST: Of the four fish Vic caught, one is a poisonous puffer fish, leaving only three to share for lunch between 11 ravenous men.

1163.76 1165.76 VIC: It's not going to feed the 5,000.

1168.76 1181.76 HOST:  FARMAR has convinced his nets of the group's best chance of breaking the famine, but he can't man them alone.

1183.76 1185.76 FARMAR: I actually came out here to grab Barney for the nets.
1187.76 1191.76 VIC: There's wood to be got, and it's not fair to leave two or three lads doing it,
1191.76 1193.76 FARMAR: but I thought it was a 20-minute job.
1193.76 1196.76 DAN: That's one of the woods.
VIC:  Shit! What made you think that?
1196.76 1198.76 VIC: Are you doing a full day on wood yet?
1198.76 1199.76 FARMAR: No.
1199.76 1201.76 VIC: That's why you think it's a 20-minute job.
1201.76 1203.76 VIC: You know what I think you've done?
1203.76 1207.76 VIC: I think you have rolled them nets about there and just go for a swim every day.
1207.76 1209.76 VIC: Listen, this is what will happen, right?
1209.76 1211.76 VIC: When we get back, we forgot about all this shit.
1211.76 1213.76 VIC: People will say to me, what do you do?
1213.76 1217.76 VIC: And I'll say, every day, I sweated as hard as I could and I was as helpful as I could.
1217.76 1219.76 VIC: And they'll say to FARMAR, what did you do?
1219.76 1221.76 VIC: He said, it was a nightmare!
1221.76 1224.76 VIC: I had to swim every day for some fish that were never there.
1225.76 1227.76 DAN: My heart bleeds for you, FARMAR.
1227.76 1229.76 VIC: Yeah, mine too. Absolutely bleeds.
1229.76 1231.76 FARMAR:: You wait till we get that haul of ten stingray.
1231.76 1232.76 VIC: No problem.
1232.76 1234.76 VIC: You'll be passing me all the back.
1234.76 1236.76 VIC: But it shows you you're not self-divided, don't it?
1236.76 1242.76 VIC: Those dumb-ass yorks will be graftful with bleed and you brains down south will work every inch and blow down of us.
1242.76 1243.76 FARMAR: I hope your joking.
1243.76 1245.76 VIC: And you'll smile when you do it.
1245.76 1247.76 DAN: There you go. I'll self-help.
1247.76 1248.76 VIC: Finish that baby off.
1248.76 1249.76 DAN: I'll film you. You do.
1249.76 1250.76 FARMAR: Yeah, I'd love to.

1251.76 1253.76 VIC: FARMAR not got a day's graft in him. About FARMAR
1253.76 1256.76 VIC: Not a freaking day's graft in him.
1256.76 1261.76 VIC: I shouldn't be hard on the bloke because if you've never done it, if you're ass wiped all your life, then so be it, you have.

1264.76 1270.76 FARMAR: I think Vic has made a judgement about me that, you know, life's been incredibly easy.
1270.76 1272.76 FARMAR: And life has been easy in one sense.
1272.76 1274.76 FARMAR: I've had an incredible upbringing.
1274.76 1285.76 FARMAR: I've no embarrassment about the background I've come from or the family I have or the school I went to or the places I've been.
1285.76 1287.76 FARMAR: They are a huge blessing.

1294.76 1296.76 DAN: Oh, yeah. That's disgusting.
1298.76 1304.76 CHARLIE: After just a few mouthfuls of fish for lunch, tonight's dinner is looking even more bleak.
1304.76 1305.76 CHARLIE: Limpets.
1306.76 1309.76 CHARLIE There is probably 15 each, you will be pleased to know.
1311.76 1313.76 CHARLIE You can get a fucking eight of 15 as well.
1315.76 1316.76 DAN That's fucking horrible.

1317.76 1320.76 ROSS: We're eating barely enough to survive.
1320.76 1325.76 ROSS: We really need a haul of something, a big catch to come in or an animal to catch.
1326.76 1328.76 ROSS:  It's so sapping here.
1328.76 1332.76 ROSS: And I'm not quite sure how long we can struggle on for without a decent feed.

1335.76 1339.76 ROSS: Not too much pressure, but if you don't get any food, we're fucked, yeah, boys? So, yeah, thanks.

1341.76 1345.76 HOST: Now released from wood duty, FARMAR sets off to check his nets.
1346.76 1347.76 FARMAR: I'm pretty positive.
1348.76 1352.76 HOST: Despite the group's hostility, FARMAR’S convinced his nets will work.
1352.76 1354.76 FARMAR: I refuse pessimism to seep in.
1355.76 1356.76 FARMAR: Absolute refusal.
1356.76 1357.76 BARNEY Optimism it is, then.
1357.76 1358.76 FARMAR:  Optimism it is.

1358.76 1368.76 HOST: FARMAR knows that a big fish haul can mean not only salvation for the group, but would also restore his reputation.

1371.76 1374.76 PIERS: It's got a long way out, isn't it? Yeah, it is.
1388.76 1389.760 FARMAR: Ah!
1391.76 1392.76 FARMAR: completely empty!
1393.76 1394.76 PIERS: Nothing.
1396.76 1398.76 PIERS: Oh, it's just what I didn't want to hear.
1400.76 1402.76 PIERS: It's just so depressing. It just...
1403.76 1404.76 PIERS It's just so depressing.

1406.76 1407.76 VIC: Very predictable.
1407.76 1411.76 VIC: It's a waste of energy, time, fuel, everything. ABOUT: FARMAR
1411.76 1414.76 VIC: It's time to stop farting around and start getting somewhere worthwhile.

1415.76 1416.76 VIC: Morning.
1417.76 1419.76 VIC: And what a beautiful morning it is.

1422.76 1428.76 HOST: After a month from the island, the exhausted men are doing their best to share the most arduous daily chores between them.

1429.76 1432.76 SAM: The street's walking through the kitchen to get a pint of water.

1433.76 1434.76 FARMAR: Almost there.

1435.76 1440.76 HOST: But yesterday, FARMAR angered the group by prioritising his fishing nets over firewood.

1441.76 1443.76 CHARLIE: FARMAR checked nets.
1443.76 1448.76 CHARLIE: He would have bought absolutely diddly squads, I'm afraid to say.
1448.76 1449.76 CHARLIE: A big fat nothing.
1449.76 1452.76 CHARLIE: He has a bit of tension between the rest of us.

NOTE: CHARLIE THINKS THAT FARMAR GETS NOTHING DONE WITH HIS NETS, HE DOES NOT LIKE HIM

1453.76 1454.76 FARMAR: Pretty good.

1458.76 1460.76 PHIL: OK, let's start off today.
1460.76 1462.76 PHIL: Who's doing what this morning?

1462.76 1464.76 FARMAR: Yeah, I'm doing fishing nets.
1464.76 1466.76 FARMAR: I know it's a bit selfish.

1466.76 1468.76 VIC: No, just get cuckering into wood.
1468.76 1470.76 VIC: Don't make it a token effort.
1470.76 1472.76 VIC: Get stuck into wood. We need wood.
1472.76 1473.76 VIC: Lots of it.
1473.76 1475.76 VIC: Nets aren't delivering jack SHIT.
1475.76 1477.76 VIC: We're pissing in the wind with them.

1480.76 1483.76 FARMAR: I do feel put upon, actually, a little bit this morning.
1484.76 1485.76 FARMAR: Just by the comments.
1486.76 1487.76 FARMAR: It's just maddening.
1487.76 1491.76 FARMAR: It's absolutely maddening to be criticised and to be put down.
1491.76 1494.76 FARMAR: It's really, really hard and I had to be biting my tongue.

1495.76 1496.76 WILL: You OK?
1496.76 1497.76 FARMAR:  Is Vic about it?
1497.76 1498.76 WILL: Do you need a chat with him?
1498.76 1500.76 FARMAR Yeah, I might have a chat.

NOTE: WILL CHECKS ON FARMAR

1501.76 1507.76 HOST: After days of criticism, Sam is determined to get to the bottom of Vic's hostility.

1508.76 1509.76 FARMAR: Vic?
1509.76 1510.76 VIC: Yo!
1510.76 1511.76 FARMAR: Do you trust me?
1511.76 1513.76 VIC: I would never trust a stranger.
1513.76 1514.76 FARMAR: OK, am I a stranger?
1514.76 1515.76 VIC: At first you were.
1515.76 1516.76 FARMAR: OK.
1516.76 1522.76 VIC: It's taken me longer to get used to you than it has any of the guys because they sound a little bit like me.
1522.76 1525.76 VIC: You're the first person I've ever met that actually speaks like this.
1526.76 1530.76 FARMAR: Am I suffering your prejudice because of a bad experience?
1530.76 1534.76 VIC: From where I come from, we vote one to three, four years on a government, yeah?
1534.76 1535.76 VIC: Yeah.
1535.76 1537.76 VIC: The person we vote for speaks like you.
1537.76 1544.76 VIC: And we put every last vestige of trust in that person and then you dick us every single time.
1544.76 1560.76 VIC: I have more respect for a man who will break through my front door and steal my telly when I'm on holiday than I do that man that tells me on...that does this and don't point because it's rude and emphasises with his hands and he's got a great speaking voice and Boris and all that sort of shit.
1560.76 1568.76 VIC: I have no respect whatsoever because they are thieving, lying, clever people with affluence and money and a good voice and a fantastic education.
1568.76 1571.76 FARMAR: Vic, you're basically saying you're all the same.
1571.76 1572.76 FARMAR: That's what you were basically saying.
1572.76 1576.76 VIC: But yes, which is practice, lack of education, lack of understanding, lack of experience.
1576.76 1577.76 FARMAR: Might be the reality.
1577.76 1580.76 VIC: We might be because I'm trapped in a working class life.
1580.76 1584.76 VIC: People with power and influence, they just abuse a little man every time.
1584.76 1586.76 FARMAR: You assume I do have power and influence.
1586.76 1589.76 FARMAR: I mean, it's little old me.
1589.76 1594.76 VIC: But it's difficult to get rid of all them years of listening to people with accent and class.
1594.76 1598.76 VIC: Tell you one thing and do a total different thing because then you don't trust them at all.
1598.76 1600.76 VIC: So, unfortunately, I don't trust you.
1600.76 1601.76 FARMAR: Yeah.
1603.76 1604.76 FARMAR: Interesting.
NOTE: VIC DOESN'T LIKE FARMAR

1608.76 1610.76 FARMAR: It was hard to hear.
1610.76 1611.76 FARMAR: I hate conflict.
1611.76 1625.76 FARMAR: I have a choice, either just to try and ignore it or I can try and embrace it and show him that actually I'm very different from those that have put him down in the past.
1625.76 1630.76 FARMAR: And my hope is that he will see me by the end of this experiment.
1630.76 1633.76 FARMAR: He will see me as a person who's on his side.

1634.76 1637.76 HOST: For centuries, you know, the British have been totally class-driven,
1637.76 1645.76 HOST: almost class-obsessed, and it's like a pathological disorder where people get fixated and where they feel they stand.
1645.76 1648.76 HOST: In that pecking order, are they lower, middle or upper classes?
1648.76 1654.76 HOST: But if the men are going to survive here, they've got to put aside those prejudices and work as a team.

1663.76 1669.76 VIC: Right, people, the fishing we will go. Whoo! I'm away, boys! Catch some supper!
1669.76 1671.76 VIC: Let's have some fish.
1671.76 1673.76 VIC: We can all have a decent meal.

1674.76 1683.76 HOST: With nothing to eat in camp, the starving men have decided to use their last reserves of energy on one big concerted effort to find food.

1683.76 1685.76 WILL: Jesus Christ.
1685.76 1687.76 WILL: Oh, fuck, yes!
1687.76 1689.76 SAM: Get him. Get him.
1689.76 1691.76 SAM: Get him. Get him.
1693.76 1695.76 WILL: Come on! OK.
1695.76 1697.76 WILL: Oh, his tail snapped off.
1697.76 1700.76 WILL: Didn't nobody snake do that?
NOTE: SAM AND WILL WORKING TOGETHER TO GET FOOD

1702.76 1708.76 HOST: Despite opposition from the rest of the group, FARMAR has decided to persevere with his nets.
1709.76 1712.76 FARMAR: You just have to keep trying, keep trying, keep trying.
1712.76 1715.76 FARMAR: Sometimes you fail, and sometimes you're successful.

1719.76 1721.76 VIC: We have a first victim down there.
1721.76 1722.76 ROSS:: Oh, you say then?
1722.76 1724.76 VIC: Being the top fish catcher...
1724.76 1726.76 VIC: Pressure's on. Yeah, the pressure is on.
1726.76 1730.76 VIC: But I also think the mark of a man is him rising to pressure.

1731.76 1735.76 PHIL: We still haven't got anything, anything, anything.
1736.76 1739.76 PHIL: Desperately, desperately need food.


1739.76 1744.76 HOST: After five exhausting hours, the men have found nothing for dinner.

1745.76 1748.76 VIC: Jesus Christ, look at the fucking... You bastard!
1749.76 1751.76 VIC: Took the hook and the lot.
1752.76 1754.76 VIC: That's bad. Fuck off.

1755.76 1759.76 HOST: Even the island's top fisherman, Vic, has had to admit defeat.

1760.76 1762.76 VIC: Son of a bitch. I'm gutted.
1763.76 1767.76 VIC: I really want to bring in a nice haul for guys tonight to eat, you know what I mean?
1768.76 1769.76 VIC: Fuck!

1771.76 1777.76 HOST: Exhausted, starving, hungry and despondent, the men gather back in camp.

1778.76 1779.76 WILL: So what's the plan, guys?
1779.76 1781.76 SAM: Try not to slash my wrist.

1781.76 1787.76 HOST: Without a single scrap of food to show for a day's hunting, the group are out of options.
1788.76 1791.76 HOST: Save one unlikely potential saviour.

1792.76 1795.76 FARMAR: What would you feel about all of us getting the net in today?
1797.76 1800.76 FARMAR: Let's say after this meeting, we all trooped down there.
1800.76 1802.76 FARMAR: I mean, I'm being a bit hopeful.
1802.76 1804.76 VIC: How do we empty the net? You've got to bring them in.
1804.76 1805.76 DAN: I'm going to have to pull them in.
1805.76 1806.76 VIC: Ooh, fucking...
1809.76 1812.76 KYLE: I think it'd be quite good if we could pull together and get these things done.
1812.76 1814.76 CHARLIE: Yeah, fuck it. Count me in.
1814.76 1816.76 DAN: Should we click on? Fair enough.
1818.76 1820.76 VIC: Yes, I'll come in the water and pull the net.
1820.76 1821.76 FARMAR: Brilliant. Yeah?
1821.76 1823.76 VIC: Brilliant. Sounds good to me.
1823.76 1824.76 VIC: Yeah? Sounds good.
1824.76 1826.76 VIC: Where did you go?
1828.76 1830.76 ROSS: Bring home the bacon.
1830.76 1831.76 ROSS: Bring on the fish.
1831.76 1833.76 SPEAKER_08  That's some fishy spot for this.

1833.76 1838.76 HOST: In desperation, the men agree to give Sam's nets a final chance.
1838.76 1840.76 VIC: You don't give up. I'll give him that, bless him.
1840.76 1845.76 HOST: But they are now making a dangerous gamble with their last reserves of energy.

1848.76 1850.76 FARMAR: Please be fishing this net.
1850.76 1851.76 FARMAR: OK, you ready?
1851.76 1853.76 SPEAKER_10  Ready, ready? One, two...
1863.76 1864.76 FARMAR: Yes!

NOTE: FARMAR CAUGHT FISH IN HIS NET AND BROUGHT FOOD

1867.76 1868.76 CHARLIE:  No way, man.
1869.76 1872.76 CHARLIE: There's a lot of whooping coming from those nets, people.
1876.76 1878.76 CHARLIE: Where have you got it? 
PHIL: Fuck me.
1879.76 1881.76 WILL: How many do you think you've got, Sam?
1881.76 1883.76 FARMAR: I don't know. 
VIC: Jesus Christ.
1884.76 1886.76 VIC: I'm going to fly out. He's going to overdrive.
1887.76 1890.76 VIC: Where's your first one, boys? Oh, yeah.
1890.76 1892.76 VIC: Oh, there's the second one, boys.
1892.76 1896.76 VIC: Under third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh... Fuck off.
1897.76 1900.76 VIC: I'm telling you, I'm not going to come here.
1900.76 1901.76 VIC: Oh, yeah!
1902.76 1903.76 PIERS: Wow!
1903.76 1904.76 PIERS:  Look at that!
1904.76 1905.76 ALL: Oh, God!

VIC GIVES FARMAR A HUG TOO FOR FINDING FISH

1925.76 1926.76 VIC: God!
1927.76 1928.76 VIC: Oh, God!
1929.76 1930.76 VIC: God!

1936.76 1937.76 VIC: Oh, my God!
1937.76 1939.76 VIC: I have a newfound respect.
1939.76 1940.76 VIC: I really do.
1941.76 1942.76 VIC: That is brilliant.
1943.76 1945.76 VIC: That was the hardest thing I've had for a long time.
1945.76 1947.76 VIC: A big fishy look for the old man of the fish.
VIC HUGS FARMAR AGAIN
1947.76 1948.76 VIC: Goodbye!
1948.76 1951.76 FARMAR: Thank you, Vic. Thank you, very kind.


1952.76 1956.76 WILL: Finally, the nets come good, and that's all Farmer's doing.
1956.76 1959.76 WILL: He's been working tirelessly to get that.
1959.76 1964.76 WILL: I think that FARMAR's going to be kind of accepted as more a part of the team now.
1966.76 1968.76 KYLE: Share the loves... 
PHIL: That looks heavy.
1968.76 1970.76 SPEAKER_21  OK, guys.
1971.76 1973.76 FARMAR: The first fish. Yes!
1973.76 1975.76 FARMAR: Second. Hello.
1975.76 1977.76 SPEAKER_08  Second!
1977.76 1980.76 PHIL: All I wanted was just a fish. One fish.
1980.76 1982.76 PHIL: How many fishes have we got?
1983.76 1986.76 VIC: 21!
1989.76 1991.76 CHARLIE: Gentlemen of the nets.
1991.76 1993.76 SPEAKER_22  Well done, then, guys.
1993.76 1995.76 DAn: 21.
1995.76 1998.76 DAN: Little fishies for the dishes.
1999.76 2001.76 VIC: Dinner's ready, boys!
2002.76 2003.76 VIC: Nice.

2004.76 2010.76 HOST: It just goes to show the reality is, in a survival situation, it's the ultimate systematic leveller.
2010.76 2014.76 HOST: There's only one class that matters. Survival class.

2015.76 2017.76 VIC: FARMAR's determination's been amazing with them nets.
2017.76 2019.76 WILL: Oh, I'm really happy that you can see that.
2019.76 2021.76 VIC: Yes, I couldn't.
2021.76 2023.76 VIC: I won't deny it. I couldn't see it at all.
2023.76 2026.76 VIC: I just thought, well, you're a big city fanny.
2026.76 2029.76 VIC: But the big city fanny's done good.
2029.76 2032.76 VIC: Farmer, my hat comes off to you, sir.
2032.76 2039.76 VIC: Well done, you, for having the balls and the determination to fix them every time, because that certainly weren't my cup of tea at all.
2039.76 2042.76 VIC: Well done, him. Thank you.

2042.76 2047.76 PIERS: I just like to say massive thanks, and I raise my hand up to Farmer.
2047.76 2049.76 ALL: Farmer!
2049.76 2051.76 VIC: Well done, big fella.
2051.76 2053.76 VIC: Phone to the fishy feast. Here, here.
2053.76 2055.76 VIC: Little bit of loss, fella.


2056.76 2062.76 HOST: Last night, the men had a hearty 21-fish supper, thanks to Farmer's nets.
2064.76 2070.76 HOST: But following the feast, 36-year-old Will is the only member of the group who's out of bed.

NOTE: COMMUNAL DINING WITH FISH +1 EVERYONE

2070.76 2074.76 WILL It's half past eight. No one's awake.
2074.76 2076.76 WILL: They're gonna make a lot of noise.
2076.76 2077.76 WILL: It's half past eight.
2077.76 2079.76 WILL: Someone's been up for two and a half hours.
2079.76 2082.76 WILL: Normally, they finish their morning meeting by now.

2083.76 2088.76 HOST: Will's worried the men aren't making the most of the energy they got from last night's meal.

2090.76 2092.76 VIC: I take it we're all getting up.
2092.76 2094.76 VIC: Morning.
2097.76 2099.76 VIC: I'm glad you woke me up, Pard, and slept in.
2101.76 2103.76 PIERS: What do you mean?

NOTE: VIC IS MAD AT WILL BECAUSE HE IS DEMANDING EVERYONE GET UP EARLY TO DO WORK (VIC <-> WILL -1) (WILL -> GROUP -1)

2103.76 2107.76 WILL: This is a complete one-off, unique opportunity.
2108.76 2113.76 WILL: I want to ring out every last possible experience out of it.
2116.76 2118.76 WILL: I think we need a general camp wake-up call.
2118.76 2121.76 WILL: It was up by state, and most people were still in bed.
2121.76 2129.76 WILL: We sat around this campfire every night and said, oh, yeah, I want to go romping around the island, I want to catch a piggy, I want to get caiman, I want to do traps, I want to do this, I want to do that.
2129.76 2135.76 WILL: Doing all these things, but two and a half hours of daylight's gone, and I think it's just a bit of a shame.
2135.76 2137.76 VIC: Are you insisting we get up?
2137.76 2139.76 WILL: No, I'm not insisting any.
2139.76 2144.76 VIC: I know somebody was upset this morning, because it was a crescendo of boom, boom, boom, for an hour.
2144.76 2146.76 VIC: You can bang boxes and kick all you want.
2146.76 2149.76 VIC: We're all grown-ups. Nobody's telling me what time to get up.
2149.76 2151.76 WILL: I'm not telling you. I'm not telling you.
2151.76 2153.76 VIC: Nobody's telling me what time to get up.
2153.76 2155.76 WILL: You're making it sound like I was doing that on purpose.
2155.76 2157.76 VIC: No, not at all, were you?
2157.76 2159.76 WILL: No, of course not.
2159.76 2162.76 VIC: then why would I think that I just laid there laughing, thinking, that's quite funny.

2162.76 2164.76 WILL: You'd be making noises. You'd be wanting us to wake up.
2164.76 2170.76 WILL: We weren't asked to wake up about half past eight of you banging boxes and make you crash and bang, and I was laughing to myself.
2170.76 2172.76 WILL: I'm going to stay in bed and prove a point.
2174.76 2176.76 WILL: Bit childish.
2176.76 2178.76 WILL: How old are you? TO VIC

2181.76 2186.76 HOST: 11am. The men finally crack on with the day's business.

2186.76 2188.76 FARMAR: We've got a fish!
2189.76 2194.76 HOST: Having been out overnight, Sam Farmer's nets are continuing to bear fruit.
2194.76 2196.76 FARMAR: That's another fish below you as well.
2196.76 2198.76 FARMAR: Oh, my God, this is awesome.
2198.76 2201.76 FARMAR: I'll tell you what, we've got enough fish to eat tonight, so that's good.
2202.76 2203.76 WILL How was it?
2203.76 2205.76 CHARLIE: Awesome. Absolutely awesome.
2205.76 2210.76 SPEAKER_08  They're both grooving like Cheshire cats. It's got to be good news.
2210.76 2212.76 CHARLIE: The bag is full.
2212.76 2214.76 CHARLIE: A bit of a tiddler, sorry.
2214.76 2217.76 VIC: I love tuna.
2217.76 2219.76 VIC: I love tuna.
2219.76 2222.76 SPEAKER_08  That net's working treats, isn't it?
2222.76 2225.76 SPEAKER_23  Ooh, another Chiselle from Tiber Tuna.
2225.76 2227.76 FARMAR:  18. 18. Right.
2227.76 2229.76 SPEAKER_02  Filleting.
2232.76 2235.76 ROSS: The key is in the kit of these tuna is the firmness of the flesh, see?
2235.76 2237.76 ROSS: Yeah, see, that's gone. Sorry, boys.
2239.76 2241.76 ROSS: No, it's gone.

NOTE: ROSS AND WILL IS MAD THAT THEY WASTED SO MUCH FISH AS THEY DID NOT WANT TO GET OUT OF BED

2242.76 2246.76 HOST: The men are paying a heavy price for their late start to the day.
2246.76 2248.76 HOST: Ooh, look at that.
2248.76 2251.76 ROSS: We have wasted a lot of fish today because we have got poos into you there.
2251.76 2253.76 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, we don't do that.
2253.76 2255.76 ROSS:  A lot of fish and this one as well.

2256.76 2260.76 ROSS: The moment we have a real problem with fish getting caught in the net, it's got rotten.
2260.76 2266.76 ROSS: People in that sort of overnight, fish could have been caught at 1 in the morning, they could have been caught at 11 last night.
2266.76 2271.76 ROSS: All of a sudden, you get to 10 o'clock this morning, we've been sat in a net for 12 hours going off.

2271.76 2274.76 WILL: It's 11 o'clock and we've only just pulled the fish in.
2274.76 2276.76 WILL: I think we need to get out of bed.
2276.76 2278.76 CHARLIE: Fast on. Get out of bed earlier here.
2278.76 2280.76 WILL: I think we just have a morning call.
2280.76 2282.76 WILL: We go, right, 7.30 every night.
2284.76 2288.76 WILL: I don't want to waste any more fish because we can't be bothered getting out of bed than knowing to check in the net.

2291.76 2295.76 HOST: Once again, the group's food situation looks bleak.
2295.76 2297.76 WILL: You need to head round this bit.
2298.76 2304.76 HOST: With no food in camp, fishing with a rod and line is now the men's best hope for catching something for dinner.

2304.76 2307.76 WILL: Don't be too long, mate. We've got a long way back, yeah?

NOTE: CHARLIE THINKS HIGHLY OF WILL’S IS ENTHUSIASM 

2307.76 2321.76 CHARLIE: Will is an incredible man for his energy and his ability to keep, not just motivated, but to keep the enthusiasm to follow his ideas through when he's running on empty just like the rest of us.
2321.76 2323.76 CHARLIE: It's really quite impressive.

2325.76 2327.76 HOST: On the head round, OK?
2328.76 2335.76 HOST: To get to the best fishing spot, they must navigate the island's treacherous coastline at high tide.
2337.76 2348.76 HOST: I think one of the most critical skills in survival generally is just awareness, you know, an ability to kind of assess and just take your time and think through things before you actually act.
2350.76 2352.76 HOST: But here's the danger.
2352.76 2361.76 HOST: The more malnourished, the more their judgement gets impaired, and that's when they can end up taking risks that can put their lives in jeopardy.

2362.76 2365.76 VIC: Yeah, it's looking a bit tasty down there, isn't it?
2367.76 2370.76 WILL: stop Vic, stop
2370.76 2372.76 WILL: Have we left it a bit late?
2373.76 2376.76 VIC: Right, boys, this is where it's going to get naughty.
2376.76 2379.76 VIC: Whoo! It's like that big diving board, isn't it, Chef Field Arena?
2379.76 2381.76 WILL: Too high.
2381.76 2383.76 WILL: What's happening, mate?
2384.76 2386.76 VIC: We've got some big ones coming, so let's wait.
2386.76 2391.76 VIC: The idea is to watch him coming in and wait for a flat spot, and let's go for it.
2391.76 2393.76 PIERS: Hold!
2393.76 2395.76 PIERS: Hold!
2397.76 2399.76 PIERS: There he's going!
2399.76 2401.76 VIC: Oh, shit!
2405.76 2407.76 ALL: Whoo-hoo!
2409.76 2412.76 VIC: Right, step, step, and, yeah?
2414.76 2416.76 VIC: Well done.
2416.76 2418.76 VIC: Next!
2418.76 2421.76 VIC: Now, Piers. Push off.
2421.76 2423.76 VIC: Push off, push off, push off.
2423.76 2427.76 VIC: There we go. Bingo, fella. Whoo! Big will!
2427.76 2430.76 VIC: Well, if I were you, I'd come a bit further along.
2430.76 2432.76 VIC: Camera. I can go all the way round.
2432.76 2434.76 VIC: There's no hole. No hole.
2434.76 2436.76 PIERS: You can't get all the way round.
2436.76 2438.76 VIC: Wrong incline.
2438.76 2441.76 VIC: That's OK. I'm just ready for you coming along.
2441.76 2444.76 WILL: Go across, yeah? Get your way.
2444.76 2447.76 WILL: That's fine. Easy to do that.
2447.76 2449.76 WILL: Yep.
2450.76 2452.76 VIC: Fucking Jesus.
2452.76 2454.76 VIC: Be careful!
2454.76 2456.76 VIC: Turn round, face the rock.
2457.76 2459.76 VIC: Yeah, check for loose rocks.
2459.76 2462.76 VIC: Right, aim for the hand, aim for the hand.
2462.76 2464.76 VIC: Keep hold, keep hold, keep hold.
2467.76 2469.76 VIC: Holy shit!
2472.76 2475.76 WILL: Ah! Ah! Ah!
2475.76 2478.76 FARMAR: You OK? You OK? OK. OK.
2478.76 2480.76 FARMAR:  Just get the fucking camera off!
2480.76 2482.76 WILL: I'm sorry.
2482.76 2484.76 WILL Thank you. 
FARMAR: Stay still.
2484.76 2486.76 FARMAR: Are you OK? Give me a minute.
2488.76 2491.76 FARMAR: Let's get on the danger and then test the camera, yeah?
2492.76 2494.76 WILL: That's nasty.
2495.76 2497.76 None  OK.

2497.76 2500.76 HOST: Will is losing blood and is in a state of shock.

NOTE: PIERS AND ROSS HELPS WILL WITH HIS INJURY ON HIS ARM


2500.76 2503.76 SPEAKER_23  Let's move on before we get stuck again, OK?
2503.76 2505.76 SPEAKER_23  Yep.
2505.76 2511.76 HOST: Dr Piers needs to get him back to camp urgently so he can examine the injury properly.
2513.76 2515.76 WILL: Son of a bitch.
2516.76 2518.76 FARMAR:  I tell you what, that was a massive fall.
2518.76 2520.76 FARMAR:   Totally unexpected.
2520.76 2523.76 FARMAR: Just seeing that cut was pretty scary.

2527.76 2529.76 SPEAKER_22  OK, well. Well.
2529.76 2531.76 SPEAKER_22  Dude.
2531.76 2533.76 PIERS:  It's actually quite serious.

2533.76 2535.76 HOST: Oh, shit.
2536.76 2540.76 HOST: Dr Piers can finally make a proper assessment.

NOTE: PIERS DOES AN ASSESSMENT ON WILL’S ARM AND HELPS HIM ASSESS HIS CONDITION

2541.76 2544.76 DAN: What is that you can see underneath it? Is that a muscle?
2544.76 2546.76 DAN: Is that a bone?
2546.76 2549.76 PIERS: I think he's severed one of his tendons.
2549.76 2551.76 PIERS: It's bad.
2551.76 2554.76 PIERS: I mean, I wouldn't be happy just to patch that up here.
2554.76 2558.76 PIERS: That needs a surgical exploration in an operating theatre.
2564.76 2567.76 WILL: If I have to go, I'm really gonna be... Yeah.
2567.76 2569.76 WILL: ...devastated .
2573.76 2576.76 PIERS: And at the end of the day, Will, remember, you're right-handed.
2577.76 2579.76 PIERS: It's your livelihood.
2579.76 2581.76 PIERS: You've got to be sensible.
2581.76 2583.76 PIERS: And realistic.
2585.76 2588.76 DAN: Fuck. Not good at all, this.
2589.76 2591.76 WILL:  OK, guys.
2593.76 2595.76 WILL: Just give me a minute, yeah?
2595.76 2597.76 PIERS: Give me a minute, lads.

NOTE: FAMAR AND PIERS UNDERSTANDS AND IS SAD THAT WILL WOULD LEAVE THE ISLAND 

2601.76 2604.76 FARMAR: He's such a valued part of our team.
2605.76 2608.76 FARMAR: If he leaves, I would totally feel gutted.
2608.76 2611.76 FARMAR: So I'm desperate for him to stay with us.

2612.76 2620.76 HOST: Knowing Will's injury is serious, Dr Piers has no option but to call the emergency paramedic team for a second opinion.

2621.76 2624.76 SPEAKER_23  You think he's going off the island? I do, yeah.
2624.76 2626.76 PIERS: I want him to go, in fact.
2626.76 2630.76 PIERS: It's something that can't be dealt with on the island, OK?
2630.76 2634.76 PIERS: You need a surgeon that's trained, you need a stowed operating centre.
2634.76 2636.76 PIERS:  It's real no-brainer.
2642.76 2645.76 MEDIC:  He's gone quite deep. He's a ghost there.
2649.76 2653.76 MEDIC: Injury is muscular and not just superficial, so he needs to be evacuated.
2655.76 2657.76 MEDIC: Get your stuff together, OK?
2657.76 2659.76 WILL: Yeah. All right. Fantastic.
2659.76 2661.76 WILL: Keep those free from the cops.

2663.76 2667.76 HOST: After five weeks on the island, Will's time is over.

NOTE: WILL LEAVES THE ISLAND
EVERYONE THINKS HIGHLY OF WILL BEFORE HE LEAVES AS HE WAS A LEADER FOR THE GROUP. (GROUP <-> WILL +2)

2669.76 2675.76 WILL: Smallest things, it's a simple fall like that, and it's cut my experience off.
2680.76 2682.76 PIERS: Oh, mate, I'm so fucking sorry.
2686.76 2688.76 SAM: You've been a fucking hero, mate, you really have.
2688.76 2690.76 MEDIC: Guys, we need to go right now.
2691.76 2693.76 SAM: I don't care what anyone says.
2693.76 2696.76 SAM: We've effectively had a leader out here in the spring world.
2697.76 2701.76 SAM: He's led by example, he's led by inspiration.
2703.76 2709.76 SAM: When people can't be asked or don't want to do something, he's done it himself, and he's filmed the whole thing as well.
2709.76 2711.76 SAM: The man's been a machine.
2711.76 2715.76 SAM: I think we'll regress to kind of ape men when Will has gone.

2716.76 2718.76 VIC: Cheers, son, Will.
2721.76 2723.76 VIC: Oh, he's got a sob on, honey, bless him.
2723.76 2725.76 VIC: Yeah, I think he's upset.
2727.76 2728.76 VIC: Cheers, son.
2729.76 2731.76 SPEAKER_14  Good luck, Will. Good luck.
2733.76 2735.76 VIC: Right, fella? Yeah.
2735.76 2737.76 VIC: Yeah? No, you listen, it's how it works.
2737.76 2739.76 VIC: You did your best, that's how it works.
VIC CHEERS UP PIERS AFTER WILL’S DEPARTURE

2740.76 2749.76 BARNEY: I never imagined that I'd be so gutted, so disappointed, so kind of upset with one of us leaving.
2751.76 2757.76 BARNEY: At first in the last few days, I've gotten with him so well, and I've really made a really good friend there.
