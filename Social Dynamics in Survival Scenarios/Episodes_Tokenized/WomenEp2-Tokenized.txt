0.00 41.74 HOST: Two uninhabited Pacific Islands. More than 5,000 miles from the UK. One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British women. For six weeks they'll be utterly alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools, filming everything themselves. When pushed to the limits of human endurance, will it be brute power or mental strength that wins the day?
43.34 50.34 HOST: Who will have what it takes to stay alive? Tonight we follow the women's island.
51.34 58.34 SPEAKER_31  Snake, I can't breathe! This time it will be harder than ever. They'll have to hunt for
59.98 71.34 HOST: food, find water and build shelter, living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season.
71.34 78.34 ABBY: It's like a tornado. That is terrifying. We need a great deal of magic now.
79.34 87.34 SPEAKER_33  When pitted against the extremes of nature, and these Monday women got what it takes to survive.
87.34 94.34 KATE: Guys, that is a big f***.
101.10 108.10 HOST: Four days ago, 14 British women were cast away on this remote and inhabited Pacific Island.
109.34 114.34 HOST: Already, one woman has left the island.
114.34 119.34 SPEAKER_22  I need to go. I'm sorry, I don't want to be here.
119.34 128.82 HOST: Some of the group stayed behind at the makeshift camp, whilst an expedition party went in search of a permanent base with a sustainable water source.
128.82 132.14 SPEAKER_34  It's not salty.
132.14 138.14 HOST: But with no idea how to get back to the others, they are now lost in the thickest place.
138.34 141.90 HOST: Look at the jungle.
141.90 144.42 HOST: And are completely out of water.
144.42 149.18 SPEAKER_24  We have nothing to drink. We don't know where we are.
149.18 155.50 HOST: The women left behind have just rainwater to drink. Their fire has gone out and panic is setting in.
155.50 159.66 JAMIE: Do you think he just ordered me about all the time?
159.66 167.06 HOST: With both groups now starving and critically dehydrated, their time on the island could be over before it's really begun.

<INTRO>

169.34 172.34 HOST: It's day four.
172.34 180.10 HOST: The five women left in camp have been waiting for over 24 hours for the others to return from their expedition.

180.10 186.10 CHAVALA: I feel dreadful. Honestly, I feel absolutely dreadful.
186.10 192.10 CHAVALA: I never thought I would be so desperate for food and water.
192.86 195.86 CHAVALA: We all want to get out of this camp.
195.86 198.86 CHAVALA: But we know the other group are coming back for us.
198.86 201.86 CHAVALA: We can't set off because we'll lose them.

201.86 205.86 HOST: The women are trying to relight their fire to purify water from a muddy puddle.
205.86 207.86 HOST: But their wood is damp.

207.86 210.86 CHAVALA: That's it. It's moving.
210.86 212.86 ABBY: Every time. What in the hell are we doing?
212.86 216.86 ABBY: It's actually just another groundhog day of the same shit.
216.86 219.86 JULIE It's like the best camping ever, isn't it?
219.86 221.86 JULIE: The best camping ever.
224.86 227.86 JULIE: I don't know if any of you have been camping twice, didn't I?

231.86 239.86 HOST: However bad your situation is, you have to dig deep and find that inner strength to stand any chance of surviving.
239.86 242.86 HOST: Simple principles that really make a big difference.
242.86 247.86 HOST: And one of those is positivity, positivity, positivity.

248.86 254.86 ABBY: I might as well, honestly, I might as well have gone and sat in my horses' field for five days and not eaten.
254.86 257.86 ABBY:  But just sat in the muddiest part of the horses' field.
257.86 259.86 ABBY: But the difference is I might have had a horse for company.
259.86 263.86 JULIE I don't actually mind because I love extremes of weather.
263.86 269.86 JULIE: I roar and wind and lightning and torrential rain and...
269.86 273.86 CHAVALA:  Oh, lovely. I'm pleased for you. Seriously, I'm really chuffed for you.

Note: Positive interaction between Julie and Chavala

273.86 276.86 JULIE:  I've always wanted an adventure.
276.86 281.86 JULIE:  And I think, God, I haven't done that much for myself over the last 55 years.
281.86 284.86 JULIE:  Should have done more. Should have seen more.
284.86 288.86 JULIE:  I get really wound up over the most stupid things.
288.86 298.86 JULIE:  Like, you know, when you buy expensive toilet roll and you tear it and it doesn't tear along the perforations, that really winds me up.
298.86 302.86 JULIE:  I try to stop myself talking a lot.
302.86 307.86 JULIE:  And I do like to think that other people can get away with an edge wage, you know what I mean?
308.86 313.86 JULIE:  This is day four now without any food, so we're really going to feel it today.

314.86 318.86 HOST: Earlier, the women found some yucca, a type of potato.
318.86 324.86 HOST: Mother of two Julie has decided to peel it, despite not having a fire to cook it on.
324.86 327.86 JULIE:  Oh, now, do you know what? I've just wasted that now.
327.86 331.86 JULIE:  But we could have boiled it in soup. That's what Beth was saying.
331.86 333.86 CHAVALA: I would…

NOTE: JULIE IS ANNOYING ABBY AND CHAVALA BY PLAYING WITH POTATOES INSTEAD OF SAVING THEM

335.86 339.86 ABBY: She goes on about those potatoes anymore. I'm going to stab her.


347.86 356.86 HOST: After 24 hours without a drink, the expedition party are dehydrated, hopelessly lost and wandering directionless.

357.86 360.86 GEORGINA:  Walking is painful now.
361.86 363.86 GEORGINA:  Physically, I'm not.
364.86 367.86 GEORGINA:  I just hope we can find the drink.
369.86 372.86 GEORGINA:  Can't remember that time I felt this thirsty.


375.86 378.86 KATE: Careful here, guys. It's really slippy.
379.86 380.86 SPEAKER_40  Oh, shit.
380.86 381.86 KATE: You're right.
381.86 382.86 KATE: Super slippery.
382.86 383.86 SPEAKER_24  Really slippery.
383.86 384.86 SPEAKER_40  Oh, gosh.
384.86 386.86 SPEAKER_40  Oh, f***.
386.86 387.86 SPEAKER_24  Who was that?
387.86 388.86 SPEAKER_24  That was me.
389.86 390.86 None  F***.
390.86 392.86 GEORGIE: Oh, my God, there's a caiman.
394.86 395.86 GEORGIE: That is a big f***.
395.86 398.86 GEORGIE: Oh, yes, I can see it. Straight ahead.
398.86 399.86 GEORGIE Oh, shit.
399.86 401.86 GEORGIE: F***. Oh, my God, that's f***ing sick.
401.86 402.86 GEORGIE: Yeah, it's enormous.
402.86 403.86 GEORGIE: It's watching us, though.
403.86 409.86 GEORGIE: We actually... I literally must have walked past his nose by that much. Didn't spot him.
409.86 411.86 SPEAKER_24  Did we crazy sell this for f***ing time?
411.86 412.86 SPEAKER_24  No.

412.86 421.86 HOST: Though potentially deadly to humans, a crocodile of this size could provide tens of thousands of calories for the women, who have barely eaten in days.

421.86 423.86 SPEAKER_02  Billy Big Ball's not a big ball.
423.86 424.86 SPEAKER_02  That is seriously Billy Big Ball.
424.86 425.86 GEORGINA:  I went for that one for dinner.
425.86 426.86 GEORGINA:  You're right.
426.86 427.86 SPEAKER_02  Not tight, not with a power of fire.
427.86 429.86 SPEAKER_02  We wouldn't want that.
429.86 431.86 SPEAKER_24  No, we don't have a sharp knife on us.
431.86 434.86 SPEAKER_24  We'll be back for you men. Sleep with one eye open.
435.86 444.86 HOST: With hunger and dehydration sapping their energy, and with hunting equipment left at camp, the women decide to walk away from this potentially life-saving feast.

444.86 446.86 SPEAKER_30  Right, let's get out of here.
446.86 448.86 JAMIE: It's nothing easy on this.
448.86 450.86 GEORGIE:  It's all right, it's all right.
450.86 451.86 GEORGIE:  It's all right.
451.86 452.86 BELINDA: That's it, that's it, that's it.
452.86 453.86 BELINDA: Well done.
453.86 459.86 FI:  As we know, Caiman can take off a leg and arm, drag you in the water, drown you, eat you. Not great, really.
459.86 462.86 FI: So we all want to be out of here as fast as possible.
462.86 465.86 FI: And as an exit operation, we're doing quite well.

Note: georgie and fi are positive with the group’s exit operation

468.86 470.86 JAMIE: Oh, don't you dare.
471.86 473.86 JAMIE: Too late, baby.
473.86 475.86 SPEAKER_36  It's too late.

477.86 480.86 HOST: For these women to succeed, they've got to have faith.
480.86 485.86 HOST: They've got to persevere and reunite because there's power in numbers.
485.86 488.86 HOST: My mantra is leave no man behind.
489.86 493.86 HOST: It's that sort of attitude that's going to make the critical difference for them.

494.86 496.86 FI:  I've got a beach on my left.
499.86 501.86 GEORGINA: Let's get on there, let's get an orientation.

502.86 511.86 HOST: The women have been trekking through the jungle for two hours, but instead of finding camp, they've stumbled upon another beach on the north of the island.
 
511.86 513.86 LAUREN: This is so hard.
514.86 516.86 LAUREN: No one knows what the right decision is.
517.86 519.86 LAUREN:   So fast today.

520.86 523.86 JAMIE: I've never been so dehydrated, oh my.
523.86 526.86 JAMIE: I'm thinking about drinking seawater.
526.86 529.86 JAMIE: I know you can't, but I'm not that bad.

529.86 533.86 HOST: The women scavenge the area and strike lucky.

533.86 536.86 GEORGINA:  We found coconuts. Oh, my God!

537.86 539.86 HOST: It's just enough to keep them going.

539.86 541.86 SPEAKER_02  Come on, let's go, let's go.
541.86 542.86 SPEAKER_02  Let's do it.

542.86 546.86 HOST: As they head back into the jungle to try and find the others once more.
552.86 556.86 HOST: At camp, the damp conditions are proving problematic.

556.86 559.86 JULIE: I really, I was just trying to start another fire.
559.86 561.86 JULIE It's just finding the dry stuff.

561.86 563.86 CHAVALA: No, son, we can't see the sky.
563.86 565.86 CHAVALA: Oh, but look at your little hands.
565.86 567.86 CHAVALA: My hands, I mean, like...
567.86 568.86 CHAVALA: Look, look.
568.86 570.86 BEKI: It's just from the wetness.
570.86 573.86 CHAVALA: The dinner crap, I mean, I'm in agony.

574.86 578.86 CHAVALA: I've achieved everything I wanted to in my profession.
578.86 584.86 CHAVALA: I'm really happy with where I've got to, but I think my job is starting to define me, and I don't want that.
584.86 587.86 CHAVALA: I want to find out who I am again.
587.86 589.86 CHAVALA: I think I have a need for adventure.
590.86 595.86 CHAVALA: I just feel so driven to do something completely different.
595.86 600.86 CHAVALA: It's crazy.
600.86 602.86 CHAVALA: I can't let it get in my head.
602.86 604.86 CHAVALA: You can't let it get in the air.

Note: chavala and beki are bonding about keeping their composure and staying positive

604.86 605.86 BEKI: No.
605.86 606.86 CHAVALA: It's important to be positive.

606.86 607.86 BEKI: Right.
607.86 608.86 CHAVALA It will work out.
608.86 609.86 BEKI: Yeah.
609.86 610.86 CHAVALA: It will.
610.86 612.86 BEKI:  We're about to work out how to make a great shelter today.

614.86 623.86 HOST: Unable to make fire without dry wood, a shelter will protect the women from the elements while they wait for the others to come back for them.

623.86 624.86 ABBY: Push that down.
624.86 625.86 ABBY: No.
625.86 626.86 ABBY: No, this, the top one.
626.86 627.86 ABBY: Push that down.

627.86 629.86 BEKI: I'll tell you what, there really is strength in numbers.
629.86 635.86 BEKI: You really feel that there's so much more work and so much more pressure on you when there's just a small amount of you.
636.86 637.86 FRAN: Oh, shit.
637.86 638.86 FRAN: That was it.
638.86 639.86 BEKI: There we go.
639.86 642.86 BEKI: Now, with just five of us, it feels pretty lonely, actually.

642.86 646.86 HOST: Half an hour later, and the shape of a shelter is almost complete.
646.86 648.86 HOST: It looks pretty good.

648.86 650.86 ABBY: Oh, fuck's sake.
653.86 654.86 None  No.
656.86 659.86 BEKI: Positivity, positivity, positivity.

663.86 673.86 HOST: The expedition party left what they've nicknamed Coconut Beach nearly two hours ago, and they are trekking into the thick of the jungle, trying to find a camp
.
673.86 674.86 KATE: No, we're going back on ourselves.
674.86 675.86 KATE: We need to go that way.
675.86 677.86 KATE: There's the other coast FI.

Note: kate and Fi are still conflicting about where to go

677.86 680.86 HOST: With the afternoon temperature rising to over 30 degrees...
681.86 682.86 GEORGIE: I'm so thirsty.
683.86 687.86 HOST: ..the need for water is more critical than ever.

688.86 691.86 GEORGIE: My biggest motivation is to get to the others.

694.86 699.86 HOST: Convinced they're close to camp, Georgie and Lauren go ahead to reckon their surroundings.

Note: GEORGIE and LAUREN are splintering off from the main group, they are working together to see where the right direction is to go (-1 everyone, +1 for the two)

699.86 701.86 GEORGIE: We're just looking.
705.86 707.86 LAUREN: Come back to where we are.
707.86 709.86 GEORGIE:  No fucking way.
709.86 711.86 GEORGIE: Can't be.
711.86 712.86 LAUREN:  We are?
712.86 714.86 GEORGIE: No, we can't be.
714.86 716.86 LAUREN:  We haven't done one massive...
716.86 718.86 GEORGIE: Yeah. Really?

722.86 731.86 HOST: The expedition party has spent all day in the searing heat, only to find they've walked in one big circle, back to Coconut Beach.
 
733.86 736.86 Kate: Guys, do you want to come down? OK.

736.86 746.86 HOST: Without a GPS or visual landmarks to guide us, human beings are naturally prone to walking circles, even when we're convinced we're going in a straight line.
746.86 753.86 HOST: Put dehydration into the mix, which slows down brain function, and the women find themselves in crisis.

753.86 756.86 KATE: OK, so there's some bad, bad news.
756.86 758.86 KATE: We're back to everyone.
758.86 764.86 HOST: If the women don't find a proper water source soon, their time on the island will end.
764.86 768.86 KATE: Bad news is we fucked up and we've just done a massive circle and we've wasted a load of energy for nothing.
768.86 770.86 KATE: How the fuck did that happen?
770.86 772.86 KATE: All too easily. We're in the jungle.
772.86 774.86 FI and GEORGIE: We have no point of reference.

Note: -0.5 THE ENTIRE GROUP IS FAILING TO GET BACK AND IS DISCOURAGED

774.86 777.86 GEORGIE: And we're tired and dehydrated.
777.86 780.86 GEORGIE: I vote we bed in for the night.
780.86 782.86 GEORGIE: I think I'm going to cry, George.
782.86 784.86 GEORGINA: I think I'm going to cry, have you?
784.86 786.86 GEORGINA: This is absolutely... Fucking ludicrous.
786.86 788.86 GEORGINA:  Ludicrous.
788.86 790.86 GEORGINA:  Physically, I don't know, people have got holes in their feet.
790.86 792.86 GEORGIE:  I have now.
792.86 793.86 GEORGINA:  We can't sustain this.
793.86 796.86 JAMIE:  Oh, my God, what are people going to do back at the camp?

798.86 805.86 HOST: Four days ago, I abandoned a group of ordinary British women on a remote and inhabited Pacific island.
805.86 812.86 HOST: After separating over 24 hours ago, the expedition party are desperately trying to get back to camp.
812.86 817.86 HOST: But disorientated by the jungle, they remain in the north of the island.
817.86 825.86 HOST: The women left waiting at camp have no fire to purify water and are also worryingly dehydrated.

826.86 830.86 CHAVALA:  We're drinking water on a roof.
830.86 833.86 CHAVALA: like wild animals.

833.86 836.86 HOST: Mum of two, Julie, has been down at the rocks
836.86 842.86 HOST: washing the women's muddy underwear.

844.86 846.86 JULIE: There's only five of us here at the moment.
842.86 844.86 JULIE:  The other group have got lost. We've no idea where they are.
846.86 851.86 JULIE:  A couple of our group have just milled in a whole lot of time.
851.86 858.86 JULIE:  I mean, for God's sake, it's supposed to be survival. It's not supposed to be a holiday.
858.86 861.86 JULIE:  You know what I mean? We knew it was going to be tough.

Note: JULIE IS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE REST OF THE GROUP’S MENTAL STATE

861.86 864.86 HOST: Facing a second night isolated from the others…

864.86 866.86 ABBY: Fuck.
866.86 871.86 HOST: ..the claustrophobic jungle environment is testing the women's mental strength.

871.86 874.86 CHAVALA But it seems very difficult to stay positive.
874.86 876.86 ABBY: I don't feel we've got anything to look forward to.
876.86 878.86 ABBY: I just feel like we've been dumped.
878.86 880.86 JULIE:  Can I say something positive?
880.86 882.86 ABBY:  No, fuck off.

Note: ABBY STILL DISLIKES JULIE

882.86 884.86 JULIE:  I don't feel too bad, you know?
884.86 888.86 JULIE:  And I just think it can only get better.
888.86 892.86 FRAN: To be fair, Julie, you really haven't gone on any expedition to get anything.
892.86 896.86 FRAN: You've kind of conserved your energy by staying in camp the most of the time.
896.86 899.86 ABBY: You are good at talking the talk. Let's do this, let's do that.
899.86 902.86 ABBY: But actually actively doing it is a different story.
902.86 904.86 ABBY:  Maybe that's why you're feeling so good.

Note: ABBY RIPPING HER A NEW ONE, SAYS SHES ALL TALK

904.86 909.86 JULIE:  I appreciate everybody is really fucking pissed off.
909.86 912.86 JULIE:  All I said was a bit of positivity.
912.86 917.86 JULIE:  I've spent fucking hours rearranging wet knickers and washing all around the camp...
917.86 919.86 FRAN:  I don't want you to do that!
919.86 921.86 JULIE:  ..and squeezing it out and hanging it up for you.
921.86 923.86 FRAN:  I've been biting my tongue all the time.

Note: FRAN AND ABBY THINK JULIE IS PRETENDING TO BE PRODUCTIVE

923.86 925.86 JULIE: You don't want me to do it?
925.86 930.86 ABBY: Personally, I feel that constantly ringing out people's knickers that aren't even here in other clothes is futile.

930.86 934.86 CHAVALA: The group dynamics of these five people is not working.
934.86 939.86 CHAVALA: It's not productive, and I'm sat here thinking, I am stuck with this.
939.86 941.86 JULIE: But we collected it at night!
941.86 944.86 ABBY: Well, Julie, but you're just wards with us.
944.86 945.86 ABBY: And they're what I said.
945.86 947.86 ABBY: Now, the fuck do you keep a fire going, then?
947.86 949.86 ABBY: No, do you know what? I'm not, you're right.
949.86 952.86 JULIE: What I'm saying is, what I'm saying is, we should collect wards and I'm...
952.86 956.86 CHAVALA: So, I'm doing this healthy now cos you really need to know how I'm feeling.
956.86 958.86 CHAVALA: SHE SNIFFS
963.86 965.86 CHAVALA:  It's really hard, yeah.
978.86 986.86 CHAVALA:  We can't eat because we have no fire. We have nothing to drink.
986.86 990.86 CHAVALA:  Because we can't boil it to pure fire and sterilise it.
992.86 995.86 CHAVALA:  I don't know where everyone else is. The other group have gone missing.
995.86 998.86 CHAVALA:  And I'm really worried about them.
999.86 1005.86 CHAVALA:  But I'm just questioning, like, how on earth are we expected to survive in this?
1005.86 1008.86 CHAVALA:  How on earth are we expected to survive in this?

Note: CHAVALA IS STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE OTHER GROUP AND UNHAPPY WITH THE CURRENT GROUP

1016.86 1023.86 HOST: On Coconut Beach in the north of the island, the expedition party remain out of water and have decided to stay the night.

1024.86 1026.86 KATE: I think that needs to go higher, yeah.
1026.86 1028.86 HOST: They're building a makeshift shelter.
1030.86 1033.86 GEORGINA:  We've basically spent two days walking for four and a half hours.
1033.86 1038.86 GEORGINA:  That's nine hours in total, just spent walking around this bloody island trying to get back to where we started.
1038.86 1040.86 GEORGINA:  Everybody's very dehydrated.
1040.86 1043.86 GEORGINA:  I had actual water for two days.
1043.86 1045.86 GEORGINA:  It's just... It's ridiculous.
1045.86 1047.86 GEORGINA:  It's absolutely ridiculous.
1047.86 1050.86 GEORGIE: And then the other side would go like that. Yeah, brilliant.

1052.86 1060.86 HOST: After spotting a storm on the horizon, the women scavenged a beach for containers to collect rainwater, their only hope of rehydrating.

1060.86 1066.86 BELINDA: We're going to have to support the bottles and this polystyrene thing to let up-track and they spill.
1066.86 1071.86 BELINDA: And we may have to keep it behind me still so that the tide doesn't push it out.

1072.86 1075.86 HOST: Finding fresh water is so important.
1075.86 1084.86 HOST: That combination of very oppressive 30-degree heat plus the humidity, you know, over 90%, can easily mean the women get through a litre of water an hour.
1084.86 1086.86 HOST: You know, that is a lot.
1086.86 1090.86 HOST: Unless they find water, I reckon the women only have one more day.
1093.86 1100.86 HOST: As night draws in, the women abandoned at camp are attempting to light a new fire to purify their muddy rainwater.

1102.86 1105.86 ABBY: Remember, all we're doing there is trying to make a hole.
1105.86 1107.86 ABBY: Help us out.
1107.86 1109.86 ABBY: Oh, fuck's sake.

1111.86 1113.86 JULIE:  So we thought we'd get a fire going tonight,
1113.86 1123.86 JULIE: but if it hasn't happened, well, I think we'll stop the dehydrated by now. I don't know where the other girls have gone from here to camp.
1123.86 1126.86 JULIE: I don't know where the hell they could be.
1127.86 1129.86 JULIE: Or what they're doing.
1129.86 1131.86 JULIE: For shelter or.
1132.86 1133.86 JULIE: Excuse me.
1133.86 1137.86 JULIE: What they're doing through a shelter.
1139.86 1141.86 FRAN: All day, Julie's been at me nonstop.

Note: FRAN IS NEGATIVE ABOUT JULIE STILL

1141.86 1146.86 FRAN: I've come on this experience with trying new things to push our comfort zones.
1146.86 1147.86 FRAN: No.
1149.86 1155.86 FRAN: Guys, can someone shine their light over here, because I swear I hear any noises?
1155.86 1159.86 FRAN: Please, it's like a... Is someone moving?
1159.86 1161.86 FRAN: It's coming close to me, please!
1161.86 1163.86 FRAN: It is Julie! It's Julie!
1163.86 1165.86 FRAN: Oh, fuck my life.
1167.86 1168.86 FRAN: Oh, shit.

1169.86 1179.86 HOST: On Coconut Beach, the storm is still in the distance, and the dehydrated women are pinning all their hopes on their makeshift containers collecting rain.

1179.86 1182.86 BETH: I've never actually wanted water so much in my life.
1182.86 1185.86 BETH: Check this lightning out behind me.
1185.86 1187.86 BETH: Yeah!
1188.86 1190.86 BETH:  It's so cool.
1191.86 1194.86 BETH:  I'm just going to actually see the line of lightning.
1194.86 1196.86 BETH: I feel like a weather girl.
1196.86 1201.86 BETH: And here we have a big, fuck off, shiny storm.
1203.86 1206.86 BETH: And to the north, we have a storm.
1206.86 1209.86 BETH: And just there, we've got a bolt of lightning.
1212.86 1217.86 BETH: And I imagine, around here, in just a moment, we're going to have a bolt of lightning.
1219.86 1223.86 BETH: And I imagine just about there, we're going to have a bolt of lightning.
1223.86 1227.86 BETH: To the right, sometimes it jumps from cloud to cloud.
1232.86 1237.86 BETH: In a moment, we're going to have a strong, north-easterly bolt of lightning right there.
1241.86 1244.86 BETH: Hang on, we're having a few technical difficulties.
1244.86 1246.86 BETH: Thank you, Bob.

1246.86 1253.86 HOST: 11pm. With the storm still a way off, the women bed down for a long night under their makeshift shelter.

1254.86 1257.86 GEORGINA We're going to speed on the sides.
1258.86 1260.86 GEORGINA All lights off.
1260.86 1262.86 KATE: Nighty night.
1264.86 1267.86 GEORGINA:  A bloody hell of a lot of you farted in my face again.
1267.86 1269.86 GEORGINA:  Sorry, I did.

1280.86 1284.86 HOST: It's 5.30am and the storm has finally hit the island.
1284.86 1288.86 HOST: The women are hoping their containers are full of rainwater.

1289.86 1292.86 JAMIE: We've just had the most uncomfortably sleep of our lives.
1292.86 1296.86 JAMIE: It's just a night now. Just hope we can get some water in as soon.

1300.86 1302.86 FI: Can I just share something with you, everybody?
1302.86 1304.86 FI: Bad, really bad news.
1304.86 1308.86 FI: We have no water because the tide has washed our bottles away.
1308.86 1310.86 GEORGIE Nothing. Fuck.
1311.86 1312.86 GEROGIE Fuck.
1312.86 1314.86 GEORGIE: I feel like I'm going to cry right now.
1314.86 1316.86 GEORGIE: I seriously think I could cry.
1316.86 1318.86 GEORGIE: I think I need a shit.

1319.86 1325.86 HOST: After almost 48 hours with hardly anything to drink, the women source just a handful of coconuts.

1327.86 1329.86 GEORGIE Oh my God, this one's gold!

1331.86 1337.86 HOST: But with only enough liquid to have a few sips each, one woman is finding it all too much.

1338.86 1341.86 GEORGINA: It's alright, Kate. Just struggling.
1344.86 1346.86 KATE: I'm really struggling, guys.
1346.86 1348.86  GEORGINA:  Come on, come on.
1348.86 1351.86  KATE:  Really, really missing my girl.

Note: GEORGINA AND GEORGIE ARE WORRIED ABOUT KATE, AND CONSOLES HER, ASKING HOW SHE FEELS, THEY SAY THEY ARE PROUD OF HER.

1353.86 1362.86 KATE: I've decided to do this because having been made redundant four times, it left me feeling worthless and a burden on everybody.
1362.86 1377.86 KATE: And I wanted to set myself a challenge and do something that was extremely difficult but that I had to do and that I can't walk away from it and have more confidence in myself and make my children proud of me and make my husband, Chris, proud of me.
1379.86 1381.86 KATE: I just feel like a bit north more than I can do.
1381.86 1382.86 GEORGINA: No, not at all.
1382.86 1384.86 KATE:  Honest to God, you were doing brilliant.
1384.86 1385.86 KATE:  You were doing absolutely brilliant.
1385.86 1387.86 GEORGINA And they're going to be so proud of you.
1387.86 1390.86 KATE: I know. I just want to speak to Chris.
1390.86 1391.86 GEORGINA: I know.
1391.86 1393.86 SPEAKER_25  And have him say, keep going.
1393.86 1395.86 GEORGIE: You can't do everything through your kids and your husband.
1395.86 1396.86 GEORGIE: You have some meat on it.
1396.86 1398.86 KATE:  But I like doing everything for you, then.
1398.86 1400.86 GEORGIE Okay, well, that's cool.

1400.86 1407.86 HOST: I think initially when people get marooned, it's all about the physical, the fact that they're tired and they're hungry and they're hurting.
1407.86 1410.86 HOST: But after a while, people become accustomed to that.
1410.86 1413.86 HOST: But then the battle becomes something much more meaningful.
1413.86 1418.86 HOST: Actually, the fact that you're missing your loved ones and those battles can be much harder.

1420.86 1422.86 BETH: I'm so thirsty.
1422.86 1427.86 BETH You haven't managed to find any water.
1427.86 1429.86 GEORGIE: I'm so thirsty.
1429.86 1431.86 GEORGIE: Look at that.

1435.86 1442.86 HOST: The good news for the women is that in tropical storm season, the weather can change in an instant.

1443.86 1446.86 GEORGINA:  Guys, guys, bring your pots.
1447.86 1449.86 GEORGIE You're running like bloody taps.

1449.86 1453.86 HOST: The return of the rain proves to be their salvation.
1453.86 1455.86 HOST: Yes!
1455.86 1457.86 None  Perfect!

1461.86 1463.86 GEORGINA:  That's amazing.

1558.86 1563.86 HOST: Mum of two, Kate, remains desperately homesick, missing her family.
1563.86 1565.86 KATE: It's due my day.
1565.86 1568.86 KATE:  Because I'm not doing another night in this jungle like this.
1568.86 1569.86 KATE: That will be it for me.
1569.86 1571.86 KATE:  And I've made that decision. If we don't make that...
1571.86 1572.86 SPEAKER_24  You feel that from the way I've fit now?
1572.86 1577.86 KATE: Yep, and I know the people who matter to me the most won't care if I come home early, to be honest.
1577.86 1579.86 JAMIE: Kate, calm down. We're going the right direction.
1579.86 1580.86 JAMIE: It might not be...

1592.86 1594.86 HOST: These women are going to survive.
1594.86 1597.86 HOST: They've got to learn quickly how to work together as a team.
1598.86 1601.86 HOST: Putting together is paramount in times of crisis.
1601.86 1607.86 HOST: And the truth is, we always survive better when we cooperate and when we don't fight.
1608.86 1610.86 BELINDA: There's only... No negativity.
1610.86 1612.86 BELINDA:  We just need to keep on this positivity.

1620.86 1624.86 GEORGINA:  Can everybody please stop arguing, because it's really not helping.
1624.86 1632.86 GEORGINA:  But maybe we should just, for the next 10 minutes, all of us just say completely nothing and just concentrate on walking and following feet.
1635.86 1637.86 GEORGINA: No, that way.
1637.86 1639.86 GEORGINA: Guys, I think we need to go that way.
1639.86 1641.86 GEORGINA: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
1641.86 1643.86 GEORGINA: 10 minutes of silence.

1666.86 1669.86 HOST: And damp conditions have brought out the jungle critters.

1669.86 1672.86 FRAN: Like, right now, all my arse is poppet into you.

1703.86 1706.86 FRAN:  Right now, my dad pays for everything that I want.
1706.86 1709.86 FRAN:  My boyfriend looks after me, especially when night's out.
1709.86 1712.86 FRAN:  They see me as their baby that they still need to protect.
1712.86 1716.86 FRAN::  I don't do anything by myself, and I want to be more independent.
1716.86 1721.86 FRAN:  I want to do something for myself and just be able to be like, yes, I did that.

1721.86 1724.86 FRAN: The worst part is I'm starting to think,
1724.86 1733.86 FRAN: and my parents were right I shouldn't have done this.
1733.86 1740.86 HOST: Back in the jungle, Forrester's daughter, Fi, has taken over leadership of the trek back to camp, but it's only taken half an hour for the mood to disintegrate.

1740.86 1743.86 HOST: We really strongly think we need to go right here.

1780.86 1781.86 GEORGIE: That was my fault.
1781.86 1783.86 KATE: We never noticed we doubled back. Because she wasn't in charge.

1783.86 1789.86 HOST: It's often when stress levels are high that all the social graces fall away, and it's also in tempest fray.
1789.86 1793.86 HOST: They've got to learn quickly how to communicate better as a team.
1793.86 1798.86 HOST: At this point, their survival and that of the women at camp depends on it.

2150.86 2154.86 ABBY: I just never, ever want to see this spot ever in my life again.

2154.86 2160.86 HOST: Until now, staying put has actually been the surest way of allowing the others to try and find them.

2160.86 2172.86 HOST: But after days with no fire, dwindling water supplies, no food, the women now need to weigh out the dangers of striking out into the unknown against a risk of waiting it out with no more resources.
