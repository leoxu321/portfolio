0.00 35.60 HOST:  Two uninhabited Pacific Islands. More than 5,000 miles from the UK. One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British women. For six weeks they'll be utterly alone. With only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools. Filming everything themselves. When pushed to the limits of human endurance.
35.60 49.84 HOST:  Will it be brute power or mental strength that wins the day? We've just caught a prehistoric animal. Who will have what it takes to stay alive. Tonight we follow the men's island.
49.84 56.84 SPEAKER_17  This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. This could be the worst decision we've ever
56.84 64.48 HOST:  made. This time it will be harder than ever. They'll have to endure the height of harsh
64.48 68.68 VIC: tropical storm season. Bring it on along the nature I say. If this is the worst you can
68.68 85.68 HOST:  do. They'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food. You lazy bunch of bone idle bastards. Have these modern day men got what it takes to survive?
85.68 103.68 SPEAKER_15  There's the artistry. Put it down.
103.68 125.68 HOST:  Two days ago I dropped 14 ordinary British men on a remote Pacific island. They've eaten next to nothing. Limpets are horrendous. And after three days of brutal tropical storms the group began to fracture. What is the matter with you? Nothing the matter with me, sir.

125.68 131.68 HOST:  Leaving three people threatening to walk off the island. I cannot face another day on here.
131.68 135.12 ANDY:  I'm not going to make the rest of the time on the island. 

135.12 157.00 PAUL: I've been having a laugh up until I heard one of my teammates say they wanted me to go. This is being freaking crazy. You don't need to go. Absolutely not. I'm not having it. I am going off design because I'm not being held responsible for that. 

157.00 163.56 HOST:  Twenty two year old graphic designer Joe, builder Andy and that construction manager Paul are all threatening to leave the island. 

163.56 168.00 DAN: It's affected you more than I thought it would have. I came here to get away from shit like this.
168.00 180.00 PAUL: Not deal with it every day. 

180.24 188.16 PIERS: So we are three men down in one day when the odds are against us at the moment. And without a full complement of people we're going to really struggle.
 You just made this survival thing probably twice as hard.

188.16 197.80 SAM: Okay slightly less tactfully guys. We stood here and talked for an hour. If it really is going to be 11 of us today, that's 11. I've got a lot of work to do to get through the rest of the day. So if you guys are not prepared to commit to the rest of the group, boom, go. Sweet.

NOTE: SAM IS TAKING THE LEADERSHIP TO GET THE GROUP TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE LEAVING (+1)

197.80 210.80 PAUL: I've made the decision I've had enough. I want to go now. Basically we've realised that a candle lit dinner with a glass of wine is a bit better than being here.

210.80 218.24 JOE: Look we knew it was never going to be easy. But it's not the survival bit that's got to me, it's just all ******* bullshit.

NOTE: SAM THINKS LEAVERS ARE SELFISH WHEN EVERYONE IS NEEDED TO STAY GOOD ON THE ISLAND

218.24 231.84 SAM: I think that's genuinely shitty. I think that's walking away and leaving the rest of us and letting the rest of us die in a big way. Not only is it a selfish thing to do, I think it's the most selfish possible time you could go when like all hands are needed.

232.36 240.28 HOST:  With Paul having made a definitive decision to go, the group are hoping that other builder Andy will now change his mind about leaving. 

240.28 245.04 ROSS: Don't leave because of someone else. If he's going anyway, stay and get amongst it.

NOTE: ROSS TRIES TO GET ANDY TO STAY, AND IS CONVINCED TO STAY


245.04 249.92 ANDY: How can I possibly stay man when a guy is leaving because of me?
249.92 255.24 ROSS: If you would have left, he would have still gone. Andy, you stay. 

Will: You can do six things at a time instead of five.

NOTE: BARNEY IS HAPPY AND YELLS YEAH
NOTE: PHIL IS ALSO HAPPY THAT ANDY DECIDED TO STAY

255.24 266.36 ANDY: I'll stay. I'll stay. Awesome. 
BARNEY: Well done Andy. 
ANDY: I'll stay.
266.36 266.88 BARNEY: Yeah!

266.88 282.88 PHIL: That's really, I'm really pleased about that. It's less worry and it's a heartache to see the others go but you know what? We're stronger. We're stronger with 12 and 11.

282.88 292.60 HOST:  As the weather breaks, Paul uses the emergency satellite phone to request his evacuation along with Joe.

292.60 308.52 PAUL: This is Paul. I would like to come off of the island. It's either me or one of the others go and I don't want me to be used as a scapegoat so I believe I am stronger than that person and wouldn't regret this decision.

308.52 322.60 WILL: It's gonna make everything so much harder. We've not been here for five minutes really and we're losing two members of the team.

NOTE: WILL IS DISAPPOINTED OF THE EARLY DEPARTURE OF MEMBERS ALREADY

322.60 340.24 JOE: I'm an happy man. I'm gonna be a happy man with a tub of Pringles and a Mars bar. 

VIC: I can only encourage them so much before you end up spending a third of your day encouraging someone not to leave. When that could be better spent time getting the things we need. Water, fire, shelter, food. 

340.24 346.36 HOST: Having lost valuable time, the priority for the 12 remaining men is to finish a shelter before another storm hits.

346.36 359.72 CHARLIE: We are running on empty but we are being stubborn and persistent. 

NOTE: KYLE IS RELIEVED THAT ANDY IS STILL AROUND AFTER EVERYONE LEFT
359.72 368.72 KYLE: Fortunately Andy decided to change his mind about leaving. At this point there's still so much to do.  We need all hands on deck so losing three people would have been a massive blow. 

NOTE: VIC THINKS ITS A SHAME THAT PAUL IS LEAVING, AND PAUL IS NOT HAPPY TO HEAR THAT
JOE: Rock peers I'm off. See you again mate.
368.72 383.12 VIC:  Yeah see you being blighty. I mean look in your go. I turn round and shake your hand mate. No it's fine. 


383.12 388.28 VIC: We're structurally integral at the moment. I don't want to spoil fun gents but there's any possibility you could step out of the area while we just start running these struts across. 
388.28 410.88 CHARLIE: Continue your conversation just sort of 10 feet over there. 

PAUL: Andy. He didn't even acknowledge me. But he know that didn't even turn around and start a picky boat. 

410.88 416.96 VIC: Unbelievable, spineless wonders, Fucking hell lads what were you thinking? What were you possibly thinking? 
NOTE: PAUL AND JOE BOND OVER THEM LEAVING TOGETHER
416.96 424.16 JOE: Just before we came out, I bought a brand new golf. Mate it's white. Oh it's beautiful. 500 pound wheels. 

PAUL: That really good though isn't it?

424.16 430.68 HOST:  After just five days on the island 14 men are down to 12.


430.68 439.32 PAUL: It was a bit emotional saying goodbye to everyone. 
JOE: Yeah of course it was. I mean in a short time we've  been here we've made quite a strong bond. Oh yeah of course we have.

NOTE: CHARLIE IS GLAD THE DRAMA IS OVER AND EVERYONE CAN MOVE ON WITHOUT THE ‘DEADWEIGHT’ (+1 BETWEEN ALL STAYERS)

439.32 447.84 CHARLIE: Now the dead weight's fucked off let's get on with it. Hang on the toilet trip we've got to do the fucking house for tonight. 

447.84 465.92 HOST: When people leave a survival group the positive thing is that what it does it galvanizes those who remain making them even more determined that they can survive. The new group may be less in number but it will be greater in strength. 

NOTE: BARNEY AND ANDY BOND OVER THEIR SHOCK OF LOSING MEMBERS
	THEY NOW HAVE RESOLVE TO STAY
BARNEY: Genuinely I can't believe that after five days we're down to 12 people.

465.92 470.88 ANDY: It is a shock isn't it? Come on 

BARNEY: it's a massive shock.  I mean do you think you'll stick it? 

470.88 494.28 ANDY: Yeah I've got no doubts about that. 

BARNEY: We've been talking about for the last kind of two days really that it would be a great shame if anybody left. But I now think we need to look at it positively and as hard as it is perhaps we've streamlined actually and more determined. I think those have stayed you know so with certain determination. 

NOTE: ANDY BELIEVES IN THE CURRENT GROUP NOW, AND EVERYONE LIKES EACH OTHER NOW THE LEAVERS ARE GONE.
494.28 505.16 ANDY:
We've got no personality clashes now in the camp everybody gets along everybody really likes each other. We're gonna have some really good bonds out of this not only the achievement of doing it which we will and a new friendship is gonna develop between us all.
NOTE: DAN, VIC, ANDY SHARE A JOKE WHILE WORKING (+1)
505.16 522.56 DAN: Teamwork makes the dream work VIC. 

VIC: Yes it does sir. Stops down at my sexy bottom not upsetting me. I could feel your eyes penetrating my underpants. 


522.56 532.96 HOST:  Maraling camp has lifted but events of the past few days have taken their toll. The men have barely eaten since they arrived on the island some five days ago. 

NOTE: THE GROUP IS BONDING EVERY THOUGH THEY ARE LOW ON RESOURCES, VIC IS GIVING HOPES TO THE GROUP THAT THINGS WILL GET BETTER (+1 FROM GROUP TO HIM)

532.96 539.52 SAM: I do feel like we're staring down the barrel a little bit. We're gonna have to pull something out of the bag or go very very hungry it seems to me.
539.52 549.48 VIC:  Are we not wise to have a real good wreck of the island? There's gonna be wildlife somewhere around that rocky bit. Yeah. There's gotta be. We need to really go through the interior of this island to find out what's living where. 

549.48 562.64 VIC: We could come across like you drive in the country and you see all of a sudden a field full of rabbits because they love a certain area. Yeah. It might be exactly the same with your goaties exactly the same with the lizards. 

CHARLIE: I think it's a really really good shot Vic.

NOTE:  DAY 6
569.52 579.80 HOST:  5am the following morning the hunt for food begins.

579.80 584.48 WILL:  Hello heroes today.  We don't want anyone to use the leg or arm or anything like that. 

WILL: You've got your stick there. I've got a stick.

584.48 636.72 VIC: I'm having a dance bird. A hunt dance. We have an alpha male in our family and obviously in my house I'm it. The dogs know I'm in charge. My wife lets me think I'm in charge. My kids look up to me as if I'm in charge. Alpha male. You know what I mean. I'm Johnny Wise, Muller, I'm Tarzan, I'm all them things. I'm looking forward to be able to know that I can come the zombie apocalypse or whatever world issue will be followed that if push comes to shove I could still provide for my family. My dream is for them guys to go that's my dad that's fantastic my dad did that. Iguanas live up trees is that right? Yeah keep your eyes absolutely peeled. Shit I wish I had any glasses.

637.24 656.40 HOST:  To ensure that these guys have a fighting chance of surviving I've made sure there's enough water, indigenous animals and vegetation on this island to keep them alive but they've got to have the ingenuity and the skills to find it hunt it and kill it. 
NOTE: PIERS AND WILL FIND A RAY AND ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO KILL IT, BUT FAIL
656.40 662.56 WILL:Rays. Fuck they're shallow aren't they? We need a weapon. We need a spear. Okay try that. Come on boys let's get one of these.
666.96 668.08 WILL: They're going deeper.
671.08 672.96 PIERS: Stingrays one, survivors nill.
677.28 694.32 SAM:: Anything that's heart is beating in its chest I will eat it. Yeah. My biggest observation about living in a jungle is how quickly you lose your sentimentality. When I look at something I'm not thinking that's beautiful or look at the little creature I'm thinking can I eat that? 
VIC: Hurry up this iguana
694.32 703.76 VIC:. Just straight through. Oh yes yes yes. Keep your eye on him. Go out and round and push him back to you.
705.52 719.84 VIC: Scamp on him you flip flops. It's there I could see it. 

WILL:There's some stingrays guys. Get it get it get it get it get it get it. Okay go go go go go get him. Oh get him. Oh get him behind it.

NOTE: PIERS, ANDY, WILL ALL ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER IN CATCHING THE STING RAYS 

722.32 727.28 WILL: Get him get him. Get it get it get it get it.
728.16 730.16 WILL: Oh
733.76 740.40 VIC: Who is there? That's dinner. Son of a bitch. He's gone.
742.80 752.88 VIC: A deaf man could hear us coming. 

ANDY: We are top predator. We've got to stay that way. If we're gonna survive if not we'll be going home shortly.

755.12 761.28 HOST:  The men's first days hunting has produced nothing. 

761.28 770.96 VIC: We are winging it and if it weren't for being such a stubborn person and so positive I think I'd have been on my way a long time ago. Just starving and dehydrating slowly is not a nice way to go. 

771.84 773.84 UNKOWN: The monsoon is coming, Here it comes.

NOTE:  DAY 7 MONSOON

775.44 779.68 HOST:  In the middle of the night the men are woken by the most vicious tropical storm yet.

785.04 788.16 BARNEY: It's amazing from nowhere you're gonna have really big wind.
791.76 793.60 DAN: Where's the pan to protect the fire?
793.60 795.60 SPEAKER_10  Yeah.
795.60 797.60 SPEAKER_10  Oh hell.

798.80 810.40 HOST:  Wow it's coming in. After yesterday's exhausting and fruitless search for food the men must now spend precious energy saving their fire. 

NOTE:  ALL WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP FIRE GOING AND ARE HUDDLED TOGETHER (+1) UNDER PROTECTION

???: This is where we dig deep boys. This is where we dig deep.

811.28 817.04 HOST:  But for some it's becoming too much. 

ANDY: Just really really tired like unbelievably tired.
817.76 819.76 BARNEY: It's got a lack of dry wood.
819.76 821.76 BARNEY:  It's a problem man.
821.76 823.76 BARNEY:  A lack of dry wood.
823.76 825.76 BARNEY:  So tonight it's gonna be a bit difficult now.

NOTE: DAN AND BARNEY ARE BONDING HERE

827.20 829.60 DAN: Barney these things are eating test of my body.
831.12 833.60 DAN: It's what we do in adversity what next is next.

867.60 869.52 ANDY: It's relentless.
869.52 871.60 ANDY: But anyway, my body's starting to take a toll now.
872.16 876.16 ANDY: Um I've got blisters all over my feet.
876.16 883.36 ANDY: I'm shivering and shaking all the time. It's just bloody horrible. It's whooped my ass big time.

NOTE: ANDY HAS RESPECT TO THE REST OF THE GROUP FOR BEING ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE CONDITIONS OF THE ISLAND

883.36 888.02 ANDY: But fair place of these other guys. I mean they're like gladiators.
888.02 889.76 ANDY: Unbelievable.
889.76 893.28 ANDY: And in comparison I'm a pussy.
893.28 902.08 SAM : He's an older guy and you know when he is starting to come up with a cut of the seams. No food, no sleep, wet, cold, beaten up.
902.16 904.16 SAM: It takes its toll.

NOTE: SAM SHOWS COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING FOR WHY ANDY IS FEELING TIRED

907.12 913.20 WILL:  How's the wood looking down? 

DAN: Terrible. Everything's just absolutely soaking wet.

913.76 917.60 HOST:  After a night-long struggle the men managed to save their fire.
919.12 921.12 HOST:  But now they're exhausted.

921.12 924.80 BARNEY:  It's a perpetuating cycle, isn't it? The more you lack in energy the less you can do.

926.80 932.88 HOST:  Having barely eaten in the last week, the bellies are rumbling. Their situation is getting desperate.

933.68 937.68 ROSS: We need to find a solid source of protein and carbohydrate.
938.64 940.64 ROSS: Well, we are going to seriously struggle.
940.88 945.84 ROSS: It's getting to the point now if we don't eat properly in the next few days, I can see other people leaving this island

967.68 969.68 ANDY: I'm not sleeping at all.
969.68 971.68 ANDY: Maybe 20 minutes.
972.40 976.08 ANDY: Even when I am lying there, my brain's still whizzing away, you know?
977.36 979.36 ANDY: They're starting to drive me fucking nuts.

1074.56 1076.56 CHARLIE: There's a lot of things that can kill you on this island.
1076.56 1080.56 CHARLIE : Snakes, spiders, crocodiles.
1080.56 1088.56 CHARLIE: The longer I'm here without a proper meal, the more I realise that if  something's going to fuck us up, it's probably going to be a lapse in concentration.

1106.56 1108.56 VIC: Forget it. We're not eating bats.

1108.56 1110.56 DAN: This island looks very peaceful.
1110.56 1112.56 DAN: You could even say heavenly.
1112.56 1118.56 DAN: But if you look just in a little bit more depth, this place is an accident waiting to happen.

1119.56 1121.56 WILL: So why are you doing this then, fella?
1121.56 1124.56 ANDY: I think because my life has been like one adventure, you know?
1124.56 1128.56 ANDY: Moving from Tenerife, Lanzarote, America, all that kind of stuff.
1128.56 1132.56 ANDY: But then, uh, the last 17 years, I've been stagnant, doing nothing.
1132.56 1136.56 ANDY: So I think this was a way of sort of saying, right, off we go again.
1136.56 1139.56 ANDY: And that it is, my friend. Yeah, certainly is, Jesus.
1139.56 1141.56 ANDY: Funny I'd have known.

1204.56 1206.56 VIC: He's going to see when he comes out.

1210.56 1218.56 HOST:  Along the coast, 29-year-old paramedic Barney and cameraman Ross are off to try their luck with improvised fishing rods.

1219.56 1221.56 BARNEY: I'm going to be incredibly positive.
1221.56 1223.56 BARNEY: We're going to get at least a couple of fish.
1223.56 1226.56 BARNEY: Yeah. At least a minimum of a couple of fish.
1228.56 1232.56 BARNEY: I've delivered three babies in the course of my seven years in the ambulance service.
1232.56 1234.56 BARNEY: And that's a pretty special feeling.
1235.56 1238.56 BARNEY: But it's not as glamorous as everyone makes out.
1238.56 1243.56 BARNEY: You see, I realise it's largely dealing with drunk people in gutters.
1243.56 1246.56 BARNEY: Vomet ridden kind of students.
1246.56 1249.56 BARNEY: I love the famous five swallows and Amazons.
1249.56 1251.56 BARNEY: Something about probably going on your own adventure.
1251.56 1253.56 BARNEY: It takes you back to your childhood, doesn't it?
1253.56 1255.56 BARNEY: Climbing trees, building dens.
1255.56 1259.56 BARNEY: It would be nice to think I've come off the island feeling a little bit more macho.
1259.56 1261.56 BARNEY: A little bit more popular with the ladies.
1264.56 1266.56 BARNEY: There's a lot of fish down there.
1266.56 1268.56 BARNEY: Come on, positive thoughts are going through the rod.
1270.56 1272.56 BARNEY: Oh, I've got a big one!
1272.56 1273.56 BARNEY Whoo!
1274.56 1275.56 BARNEY Fuck!
1275.56 1276.56 BARNEY Argh!

1281.56 1282.56 VIC:  We're down.

1282.56 1286.56 HOST:  The men have been attempting to stake out a caiman for almost two hours.
1286.56 1289.56 HOST:  But so far, they haven't seen a thing.

1290.56 1291.56 DAN: What do you think?
1291.56 1294.56 CHARLIE: I think some of our hunting team is always ready in action, ready to go.
1295.56 1296.56 SPEAKER_19  Like the coil of spring.
1298.56 1301.56 CHARLIE: It's fantastic we get caiman, but you also need to get water, fire and food.
1302.56 1303.56 DAN: I am starving.
1303.56 1304.56 PIERS: Go on, mate.
1304.56 1307.56 CHARLIE: Plus, everyone's just getting eaten to shit by these sunflats.
1308.56 1311.56 VIC: Well, let's return to camp.
1312.56 1313.56 VIC: Start to finish.
1313.56 1314.56 VIC: Absolute joke.
1314.56 1316.56 VIC: Everybody's went up there, assed about it.
1316.56 1319.56 VIC: We had no plan when we got there, no nothing.
1319.56 1320.56 VIC: We were like Keystone Cops.


1323.56 1325.56 WILL: So that's going to be great.
1325.56 1326.56 WILL: Right, I'm going to gamble this.
1328.56 1329.56 WILL: Argh!
1330.56 1331.56 WILL: Hey?
1331.56 1332.56 WILL: There you go.
1332.56 1333.56 WILL: A bit of balance, isn't it?
1333.56 1334.56 WILL: Yeah.
1334.56 1336.56 WILL: Mate, you didn't get any fucking better.
1336.56 1337.56 ANDY: Yeah.
1337.56 1339.56 ANDY: You ain't got to worry about creepy crawlies.

NOTE: WILL AND ANDY HAVE GOT A WORKING BED THAT IS OFF THE GROUND
	+THEY HUG, THEY ARE SUPPORTING EACH OTHER

1339.56 1340.56 WILL: OK, how about this?
1340.56 1343.56 WILL: If you have a decent night's kit tonight, you'll stay.
1343.56 1345.56 ANDY: I will do that, I promise.
1345.56 1347.56 WILL: OK, are we happy?
1347.56 1348.56 ANDY: I'm happy, mate.
1348.56 1349.56 ANDY: You're a wonderful man.
1350.56 1351.56 ANDY: Top man.
1351.56 1352.56 WILL: Want to hold you to it, you know?
1352.56 1353.56 ANDY: I know you will.
1355.56 1356.56 WILL: Hey, come on.
1356.56 1357.56 WILL: (They Hug)

1360.56 1361.56 None  They're here.
1369.56 1371.56 CHARLIE:  Sadly, all the cupboards are there.

1371.56 1376.56 HOST:  After an exhausting day, the hunting party have nothing to show for their efforts.
1376.56 1378.56 DAN:  It didn't look healthy, in some of these boys.

1378.56 1381.56 KYLE: Some of them looked like maybe gone on hunger strike.
1381.56 1383.56 KYLE: Well, I'm absolutely burnt out.
1384.56 1388.56 KYLE:  Today's the day where angles definitely feel like I am starving.

1388.56 1391.56 HOST:  This man needs about two and a half thousand calories a day.
1391.56 1397.56 HOST:  But the reality of a survival situation, you know, you're working hard, you're hunting, you're building shelters, chopping wood.
1397.56 1401.56 HOST:  You can easily burn in excess of 4,000 calories.
1401.56 1403.56 HOST:  The mass of that is simple.
1403.56 1406.56 HOST:  If you're burning more than you're taking in, you're going to starve.

1407.56 1409.56 CHARLIE: Can you just let the lads know that we've gone fishing?
1409.56 1410.56 CHARLIE: All right, finish.
1410.56 1412.56 CHARLIE: I'll have some energy still left for me.
1412.56 1417.56 HOST:  With nightfall approaching, the men are desperate to salvage something from the day.
1417.56 1418.56 CHARLIE: Ow!
1418.56 1419.56 CHARLIE: Ugh!
1419.56 1421.56 CHARLIE: What the fuck was that?
1421.56 1423.56 CHARLIE: Something just fucking...
1423.56 1425.56 CHARLIE: Ugh!
1425.56 1426.56 WILL: Something stung in?
1426.56 1427.56 CHARLIE: Yeah.
1427.56 1429.56 CHARLIE: Oh!
1429.56 1431.56 CHARLIE: Fuck me, do I know about it?
1431.56 1432.56 CHARLIE: You can't see what it was?
1432.56 1433.56 CHARLIE: No.
1433.56 1435.56 None  Oh!
1435.56 1437.56 CHARLIE: Definitely wasn't a scorpion, was it?
1437.56 1438.56 HOST:  I have no idea.
1438.56 1440.56 SAM:  Mike to India, Mike to India.

1440.56 1445.56 HOST:  Cameraman Sam uses the emergency sat phone to call the offshore medical response team.

1445.56 1449.56 SAM: Charlie has been stung on the toe from something in a wood pile.
1449.56 1451.56 WILL: Fuck me.
1451.56 1453.56 SAM: Oh, shit, it's a scorpion, yeah.
1453.56 1454.56 WILL: It's a scorpion, guys.
1454.56 1455.56 WILL: Rosie, let me kill her here.
1455.56 1456.56 WILL: It's a scorpion.
1456.56 1458.56 SAM: We just had confirmation it is a scorpion.
1458.56 1459.56 WILL: Over.

1459.56 1461.56 HOST: It's a general rule of thumb.
1461.56 1466.56 HOST:  The bigger the pincer, the smaller the stinger, the less deadly the scorpion.
1466.56 1470.56 HOST:  Bark scorpion, enough venom in that stinger to kill a man.
1472.56 1473.56 : Not good, man.
1473.56 1474.56 SAM: Not good.
1474.56 1477.56 SAM: I'm not sure about scorpions, but I think there is a kind that's very, very poisonous.
1477.56 1479.56 ROSS: We were told before we got here that that could kill you.
1479.56 1480.56 SAM: Fuck.
1480.56 1482.56 SAM:  Fuck, man. That's not what we need.

1482.56 1485.56 HOST:  The medics have asked Sam to urgently identify the type of scorpion.
1485.56 1487.56 HOST:  That stung, Charlie.

1487.56 1489.56 FARMAR:  Ah, dude, he's in pain, three.
1489.56 1490.56 WILL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1490.56 1492.56 SAM: OK, so that length, that is what?
1492.56 1493.56 SAM: Two inches long.
1493.56 1494.56 WILL: Two inches long.
1494.56 1497.56 WILL: So he's got big claws, which is a good thing.
1497.56 1500.56 SAM: The bigger the pincer is, the less the venom, apparently, so fingers crossed.
1500.56 1503.56 BARNEY: He doesn't look like a bark scorpion, does he?
1503.56 1509.56 MEDIC:  To treat this informatically and keep the response camp updated on the condition of the patient, over.
1509.56 1511.56 SAM:  Copy that. Will do.
1512.56 1515.56 CHARLIE: The oakin plate is so sensitive.
1515.56 1517.56 SAM: So, good news.
1517.56 1523.56 SAM: From the description of this little bad boy here, from that pincer, that probably means he's not super toxic.
1523.56 1528.56 SAM: We're going to keep an eye on you, make sure that that doesn't swell massively and you don't get any other allergic reactions.

NOTE: SAM CALLS IN THE MEDIC TO CHECK THAT THE STING WAS NOT GOING TO BE LETHAL

CHARLIE)

1528.56 1533.56 CHARLIE: It's like someone's driving roasting hot needles in and out.
1533.56 1535.56 CHARLIE: Yeah, I think you're milking a bit now, mate.
1535.56 1536.56 CHARLIE: I know, I need to suck it up, don't I?
1536.56 1538.56 CHARLIE: Oh, yeah, come on, you're supposed to be English.
1540.56 1547.56 PIERS: Thankfully, it wasn't particularly poisonous, but I must have hurt like nobody's business, poor guy.
1547.56 1550.56 BARNEY: Charlie, Charlie, keep your weight off it.
1550.56 1553.56 CHARLIE: You want to... Oh, actually, maybe keep your weight off it.
1553.56 1555.56 CHARLIE: No pride.

1555.56 1557.56 DAN: It's not nice to see anyone like that, really.
1557.56 1563.56 DAN: The boy is what I would like to call OTG. He is out the game.

1564.56 1568.56 HOST:  The medics have advised Charlie to stay off his feet for the rest of the day.

1570.56 1574.56 BARNEY: Let's go and be the saviors of today.
1574.56 1576.56 ROSS:  Come on, then.
1576.56 1578.56 BARNEY:  OK, ross.

1578.56 1586.56 HOST:  With now only an hour to sunset, paramedic Barney and cameraman Ross set out to make a last-ditch attempt to catch dinner for the group.

1589.56 1591.56 ROSS:  Yeah, let's go.

1591.56 1597.56 HOST:  But to get back to the headland where they've seen most fish, they face a treacherous scramble across the rocks.

1597.56 1600.56 BARNEY: Ah, that's quite hot, isn't it?

1600.56 1603.56 HOST:  And the tide's coming in fast.

1603.56 1606.56 BARNEY: So I feel they're in a bit of a risk, actually.
1607.56 1609.56 BARNEY: I don't like to say risk.
1609.56 1612.56 BARNEY: We're not going to gain anything by walking back now, are we?
1612.56 1614.56 BARNEY: No. Let's do it.
1614.56 1617.56 BARNEY: Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Hang on.
1617.56 1621.56 BARNEY: I have to wait for the tide to go out, and then we're 
making that gap there.

1622.56 1625.56 HOST:  So the Pacific really is just a vast ocean.
1625.56 1629.56 HOST:  It's actually the largest in the world, covering over 60 million square miles.
1629.56 1631.56 HOST:  You've got these fierce ocean currents.
1631.56 1633.56 HOST:  They swirl around these little islands.
1633.56 1638.56 HOST:  And if you get swept out into them, you really genuinely don't stand a chance.
1638.56 1641.56 HOST:  The next stop that way is the Galapagos Islands.
1641.56 1643.56 HOST:  If the sharks, dont get you first.

1646.56 1648.56 BARNEY: Now, now, now, now, now, now.
1651.56 1653.56 BARNEY: Oh, I don't know if this is a good idea to make or not.
1653.56 1654.56 BARNEY: Whoa!
1655.56 1658.56 BARNEY: Taking quite a risk just to get a fish.
1658.56 1661.56 BARNEY: Um, because then we're all so hungry.
1661.56 1663.56 BARNEY: And you've got to take risks, isn't it, really?
1663.56 1665.56 BARNEY: What do you think? Is this a bit dodgy, or...?
1665.56 1666.56 BARNEY: Good.

NOTE: BARNEY AND ROSS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO GET A FISH

1667.56 1669.56 BARNEY: As long as we're on the same wavelength.
1671.56 1673.56 BARNEY: Seas a lot of rough, though, though.
1674.56 1676.56 BARNEY: If we get swept up in, we're mince meat.
1676.56 1677.56 ROSS: All right.
1677.56 1679.56 BARNEY: So, we're going to go back to the sea.
1679.56 1681.56 BARNEY: We're going to go back to the sea.
1681.56 1682.56 BARNEY: We're mincing it here.
1687.56 1688.56 None  Listen.
1688.56 1690.56 BARNEY: One of those gates here.
1698.56 1699.56 BARNEY:  You OK, Ross?

1700.56 1705.56 HOST:  Barney and Ross finally reach the point where they want to fish, but it's now going dark.

NOTE: BARNEY AND ROSS ARE BONDING AS THEY ARE FISHING

1707.56 1708.56 BARNEY: You ever think you would be doing something like this Barney
1709.56 1710.56 BARNEY: Oh, no.
1711.56 1713.56 BARNEY: not in a million years, do you?
1713.56 1714.56 BARNEY: Go on, then.
1714.56 1715.56 BARNEY: That's so exciting.
1715.56 1717.56 BARNEY: It's that proper survival, isn't it?
1718.56 1720.56 BARNEY: It's not armchair survival.
1723.56 1724.56 BARNEY: Oh, my God.
1725.56 1726.56 ROSS: Ah!
1727.56 1729.56 BARNEY: All right, shit.
1729.56 1730.56 BARNEY: Ross?
1730.56 1732.56 BARNEY: Quick, mate. Quick, can you like...?
1733.56 1735.56 BARNEY: Fucking lost the camera.
1735.56 1736.56 BARNEY: Are you OK?
1736.56 1738.56 BARNEY: Just get up out of here, mate.
1738.56 1739.56 BARNEY: Fuck!
1742.56 1743.56 None  Fucking...
1758.56 1759.56 None  Oh, my God, stop.

1759.56 1760.56 ROSS: Camera's set on the top.
1760.56 1761.56 SAM: Hey?
1761.56 1763.56 ROSS: The camera's got fucking smashed in the rocks.


1763.56 1766.56 BARNEY: I think it's not hard to say we nearly got killed, actually.
1766.56 1769.56 ROSS: We walked up there, a few people were fishing,
1769.56 1772.56 BARNEY: and a little bit of a fine come. He was behind me.
1772.56 1778.56 BARNEY: I turned round to see a huge wave, probably about ten feet, and go for Ross, and then Ross was gone, like that.
1780.56 1783.56 BARNEY: And then I ran down and managed to grab him.
1783.56 1784.56 BARNEY: I pulled him out.
1786.56 1788.56 BARNEY: I've never been so terrified in my life.

NOTE:  DAN,ROSS, VIC SHOW CONCERN FOR BARNEY AND ROSS
1799.56 1800.56 DAN: Do you want some water or something?
1800.56 1801.56 DAN: Make some room for the guys.
1801.56 1804.56 ROSS: There's a massive wave, smashed right over me, sweating straight out on the rocks.
1804.56 1805.56 ALL: Fuck!
1805.56 1807.56 ROSS: They were all fishing, straight out, like that.
1807.56 1810.56 ROSS: Grab the rocks back out, and then another massive one to this bus stop.
1810.56 1811.56 ROSS: Shit!
1811.56 1813.56 DAN: Can we please say no more fishing at night, then, please?
1813.56 1814.56 DAN: Yes.
1814.56 1816.56 VIC: You are a bit strong, team man, aren't you?

1816.56 1833.56 BARNEY: It's really made me realise just how careful we need to be and how careful I need to be and about how vulnerable I am despite feeling as a young guy that actually you are invincible, out here, it's just not the case at all.

1833.56 1834.56 BARNEY: You all right?
1834.56 1835.56 BARNEY: You look fresh.

1858.56 1862.56 HOST:  51-year-old Andy hasn't slept well since arriving on the island.
1862.56 1864.56 HOST:  Absolutely exhausting.
1864.56 1870.56 HOST:  Concerned he'll leave if he doesn't get some quality rest, the group are hoping his new bed is the answer.

NOTE: PHIL REALLY WANTS ANDY TO STAY, AND BELIEVES HE IS A MAJOR STRENGTH TO THE GROUP

1870.56 1875.56 PHIL: Andy's got the skill set that we absolutely desperately need on the island, you know?
1875.56 1879.56 PHIL:  He's a builder by trade, so he could shortcut so many of our processes.
1879.56 1882.56 PHIL: So, you know, I want him to stay.
1882.56 1886.56 PHIL: I'm sure he didn't come on the island to fail.
1886.56 1890.56 WILL: So, if you have a decent night's kick, then you're not gonna leave us.

1931.56 1934.56 WILL: Paul's just gone because of you, Andy.
1934.56 1936.56 WILL: If you thought you were gonna go, why didn't you…

NOTE: WILL IS UPSET ABOUT ANDY MAKING PAUL LEAVE AND NOT STEPPING UP

1937.56 1941.56 PHIL: I just found out that we're losing Andy and our final builder.
1941.56 1944.56 PHIL: It's almost panic stations.

NOTE: CHARLIE IS ALSO UPSET AND WANTS TO TIE ANDY TO A TREE

1944.56 1945.56 CHARLIE: Are you suggesting we're leaving?
1945.56 1947.56 CHARLIE: Are you fucking bothered?

1947.56 1948.56 ANDY: I'm walking away.
1948.56 1950.56 CHARLIE: I'll hug you tied to a tree before you fucking go.

NOTE: SAM ISN’T HAPPY ABOUT ANDY LEAVING EITHER, AND WANTS HIM TO PISS OFF ALREADY

1950.56 1953.56 SAM: Andy's threatening to leave so very well.
1953.56 1954.56 SAM: All I do is patience.
1955.56 1958.56 SAM: Part of me just wishes if he's gonna go, he'll just fuck off, really.

NOTE: DAN IS IS DISAPPOINTED ABOUT ANDY LEAVING, AND BELIEVED PAUL WAS JUST A EXCUSE

1959.56 1961.56 ANDY: I'd like to say I want the boat here now, over and out. Bye.
1961.56 1969.56 HOST: Just a day after deciding he would stay, Andy uses the emergency satellite phone to request an evacuation.

1969.56 1974.56 DAN:  Andy Pandey is leaving today, something that I kind of predicted, really.
1975.56 1977.56 HOST:  I think Paul was just in the middle of the boat.
1977.56 1979.56 HOST:  He's just in the middle of the boat.
1979.56 1981.56 DAN: He's just in the middle of the boat.
1981.56 1983.56 DAN: He's just in the middle of the boat.
1983.56 1989.56 DAN: I think that I kind of predicted, really, I think Paul was just an excuse.
1990.56 1995.56 DAN: So really, it was a shame that Paul had to go because Andy was always gonna go in the end.

1995.56 1996.56 ANDY: Take care.
1997.56 1999.56 ANDY: I can't give myself or you guys any more, I'm sorry.

2001.56 2002.56 WILL: Fuck you, do you know?
2002.56 2005.56 WILL: The islands at 11 people after, not even a week.
2007.56 2008.56 WILL: It's just embarrassing.

NOTE: ANDY LEAVES

2008.56 2021.56 HOST:  When people leave a survival group, the remaining members can often feel the sense of desertion, betrayal, maybe even a little bit of jealousy.
2021.56 2023.56 HOST:  I mean, who wouldn't want to leave?
2023.56 2026.56 HOST:  What, for many of them, really is a living hell.
2026.56 2031.56 HOST:  But ultimately, losing a negative influence will be a good thing for the long term of the group.

2031.56 2037.56 PIERS:  It's been pretty tired today.
2037.56 2040.56 PIERS:  Really good doing some food.

2040.56 2045.56 HOST:  Eight days in, with barely a thing to eat and delayed by Andy's departure.

NOTE: CHARLIE AND VIC ARE TRYING TO FISH TOGETHER, AND ARE SHARING THEIR STRUGGLES TOGETHER

2045.56 2047.56 PIERS:  Fucking little fish.
2047.56 2050.56 HOST:  The men resume their daily search for food.

2051.56 2054.56 CHARLIE: I don't know why people choose to do this in their free time.
2054.56 2055.56 CHARLIE: Fish?

2055.56 2056.56 VIC: Yeah.
2056.56 2060.56 VIC: I don't do a lot of it. Fathering law lives it, absolutely fucking lives it. Hes a dick.

2062.56 2065.56 BARNEY: Every day is a wedding.

2066.56 2071.56 HOST:  While the others hunt, 29-year-old Barney has volunteered for fire duty.

2071.56 2075.56 BARNEY:  I'm happy, actually, just offering back at base.

2076.56 2081.56 HOST:  The group are worried that his near-death experience yesterday has knocked his confidence.

NOTE: GROUP IS WORRIED ABOUT BARNEY, AND HAS LEFT HIM TO FIRE DUTY (+1 FROM BARNEY TO ALL)
	+DAN FEELS SORRY FOR BARNEY AND WANTS TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM

2081.56 2084.56 KYLE: He literally got swept off the rocks.
2084.56 2092.56 KYLE: He's got bumps and scrapes, and if it wasn't for Barney to save in Ross's life, things would have been really serious.
2092.56 2095.56 KYLE: I think it's just a reminder of what this place is like.
2095.56 2100.56 KYLE: It just feels like everything around us is genuinely trying to kill us.

2100.56 2103.56 DAN: He's such a nice guy, so easy to relate to.
2103.56 2107.56 DAN: But I just felt a little bit sorry for him today, so I'm going to keep my eye on Barney.

2113.56 2116.56 SAM: I think he was crying there just before you got the camera.
2116.56 2118.56 ROSS: He is fine, that was really tough.
2120.56 2126.56 ROSS: He is seriously lethargic, looks seriously homesick, and he needs to get himself back on his feet.

2127.56 2138.56 HOST:  Having already lost three men, cameraman Ross has worried the group could soon be in danger of losing another, and persuades Barney to join him on a fishing trip in an attempt to lift his spirits.

NOTE: ROSS TRIES TO CHEER UP BARNEY (+1)

2139.56 2145.56 ROSS: I thought you looked really low and you weren't enjoying yourself and just looked like you wanted to get out of here.
2145.56 2148.56 ROSS: I was a bit worried that you might go, fuck it and leave.
2148.56 2151.56 BARNEY: I think everyone is having their low days too, right?

2152.56 2165.56 HOST:  After any sort of frightening near-death experience, it's very normal to become withdrawn and a little bit introverted, and people tend to then do everything they can to avoid having to face that same fear.
2165.56 2169.56 HOST:  But trying to survive on a desert island, the men don't have that luxury.
2169.56 2173.56 HOST:  They need to conquer their fear, otherwise it will conquer them.

2174.56 2180.56 BARNEY: I'm finding it difficult now actually. I feel like I've had enough of being here.
2181.56 2184.56 BARNEY: And every time I think about my family, I find it more difficult.
2185.56 2191.56 BARNEY: And I realise that this week is the week that I'm meant to be set to pass.
2191.56 2202.56 BARNEY: I've just waited to kind of apologise.


2209.56 2211.56 VIC: There's a little blue fish down here.
2211.56 2213.56 CHARLIE: Have you got a spear? Yeah.
2214.56 2215.56 VIC: That makes a fish.
2215.56 2217.56 VIC: It's a fucking good fish, I know that.
2218.56 2219.56 VIC: Basket.

2220.56 2223.56 HOST:  In their first week on the island, the men have barely eaten.
2224.56 2227.56 HOST:  That spear's not worth donkey pull. Fucking rubbish.
2228.56 2232.56 HOST:  All of their attempts to find a decent meal have ended in failure.

2232.56 2235.56 VIC: Hold on today, but that's why it's called fishing and not catching.

2236.56 2241.56 HOST:  Today's lunch for 11 famished men is slim pickings from the jungle floor.

2242.56 2244.56 FARMAR:  Guys, this is exciting.
2244.56 2245.56 DAN:  Scorpion.
2245.56 2248.56 FARMAR:  It's got a few ants on at the moment because we killed it about half an hour ago.
2250.56 2252.56 FARMAR:  But who's up for an elite?
2252.56 2253.56 FARMAR:  Yes, please.
2254.56 2256.56 DAN:  Fuck it, I'll eat it. Heaven in your mouth.
2256.56 2257.56 FARMAR:  Burn the ants off.

NOTE: FARMAR BRINGS A DEAD SCORPIAN, GROUP ALL JOKES ABOUT THE SCORPIAN, DAN EATS THE SCORPIAN

2262.56 2264.56 VIC: Where's he going? I'm going to give it to him then.
2264.56 2265.56 VIC: Why can't I have any?
2265.56 2266.56 VIC: Because you're too northern.
2267.56 2268.56 VIC: I'm too northern.
2268.56 2271.56 VIC: I'm feeling victimised because I'm the northern one.
2271.56 2273.56 VIC: That's it, you can all kiss my ass.

2275.56 2277.56 FARMAR:  You're a brave man, Dan. What's it like?
2278.56 2279.56 DAN: It's pretty gross.
2279.56 2280.56 VIC: Is it?
2280.56 2281.56 DAN: It's like eating crispy poo.
2281.56 2282.56 VIC: Is it?
2282.56 2283.56 DAN: Yeah.
2283.56 2284.56 VIC: I'm glad it was you then.

2285.56 2288.56 HOST:  In a survival situation, every mouthful counts.
2289.56 2290.56 HOST:  Tell you what, better than limpets.
2291.56 2292.56 BARNEY: Is it?

2292.56 2297.56 HOST:  But one scorpion between 11 grown men is nowhere near enough to save them from starvation.

2298.56 2301.56 KYLE: It's hard to concentrate and notice in that energy.
2302.56 2304.56 KYLE: So low, I'm so bloody burned out.

2306.56 2308.56 PHIL: Man, this place wears you down.
2310.56 2311.56 PHIL: Really does.

2312.56 2313.56 CHARLIE: Just tried standing up.
2314.56 2317.56 CHARLIE: And then started sort of got the standard headrushes.
2318.56 2321.56 CHARLIE: And then really just sort of rocking backwards and forwards.
2322.56 2325.56 CHARLIE: I don't know, only for a few seconds, but enough to put me on my arse.

2326.56 2329.56 ROSS: It's getting to the point now, we don't eat properly in the next few days.
2330.56 2331.56 ROSS: Were going to drop like flies.

2332.56 2337.56 HOST:  Despite their rapid physical decline, the men have no choice but to keep on hunting.

NOTE: FARMAR PERSAUDES BARNEY TO GO OUT HUNTING, TO KEEP BARNEY FOCUSED

2338.56 2342.56 FARMAR: It's quite a daunting thing, isn't it? The idea that we might come across Hayman today.
2343.56 2348.56 HOST:  37-year-old Sam has persuaded Barney to join him in a bid to keep him busy after his accident.

2349.56 2352.56 BARNEY: I can't convey how tough this whole thing has been, actually.
2352.56 2354.56 BARNEY: Far, far tougher than I thought.
2355.56 2363.56 BARNEY: I'm really, really struggling to stay focused and to keep up with the rest of the team.

2364.56 2365.56 FARMAR: There's a berry on this tree here, look.
2366.56 2367.56 BARNEY: Doesn't look edible, does it?
2368.56 2370.56 FARMAR: Shit the dog! Shit the dog!
2371.56 2374.56 FARMAR: Look at that! A big, big lizard under here.
2375.56 2377.56 FARMAR: It's an Iguana, I can see it's a big one.
2378.56 2379.56 BARNEY: Yes, keep going.
2380.56 2381.56 BARNEY: Yes, there you go, good.
2382.56 2384.56 FARMAR: OK. You see him there? I'm going to flick him out.
2385.56 2387.56 FARMAR: OK, here he comes, here he comes, here he comes.
2388.56 2390.56 FARMAR: Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes. OK, watch that tail.

NOTE: FARMAR AND BARNEY SUCCESSFULLY GRAB THE IGUANA THROUGH TEAMWORK, INCREDIBLY HAPPY, 

2393.56 2395.56 FARMAR: OK, you got him, you got him. You got his tail.
2396.56 2397.56 FARMAR: Pull him, pull him, pull him, pull him, pullynam!
2398.56 2400.56 FARMAR: You absolute star!
2401.56 2402.56 FARMAR: You star.
2403.56 2404.56 FARMAR: Oh, my God.
2404.56 2411.56 BARNEY: Hang on, hang on, hang on, let's talk about this, because actually we could use our meat alive,could we not.
2412.56 2416.56 BARNEY: Oh, my God. Well done, mate, well done.
2417.56 2418.56 BARNEY: Ho, ho, ho!
2419.56 2420.56 BARNEY: Oi!
2421.56 2422.56 BARNEY: Whoo!
2423.56 2424.56 BARNEY: Yay!
2425.56 2426.56 ALL: Ooh, yeah!

NOTE: EVERY IS SUPER HAPPY THAT THEY BROUGHT BACK A CATCH

2427.56 2428.56 BARNEY: It's a Nicky Wana!
2429.56 2430.56 FARMAR:  Oh, my God.
2431.56 2432.56 FARMAR:  Get in.
2433.56 2435.56 DAN:  Look at that size, that one.
2436.56 2437.56 VIC: Wow, buddy, that's half a leg.
2438.56 2439.56 VIC: Nice little cockabang on. Nice, generous supper.
2440.56 2441.56 VIC: Well done, fella.
2442.56 2443.56 VIC: Nice little pony.
2444.56 2445.56 BARNEY: He's a beautiful creature, actually, absolutely beautiful.
2446.56 2447.56 BARNEY: He's like a little dinosaur.
2448.56 2449.56 BARNEY: Guys, it's my little contribution to the day.
2450.56 2451.56 BARNEY: Wow.
2452.56 2454.56 BARNEY: It's an amazing feeling, you really feel you've done your bit for the team.
2455.56 2459.56 BARNEY: It's like when you give a really good Christmas present, you just really want to give it.
2462.56 2464.56 BARNEY: I was thinking, guys, about killing that iguana.
2465.56 2467.56 BARNEY: I think that's probably a bit of a personal thing I need to get over.

2468.56 2469.56 DAN: Hang on, hang on a minute.
2470.56 2472.56 DAN: Why is that such a bad thing that you don't want to kill something?
2473.56 2483.56 BARNEY: Because the reality of it is that we all eat meat that's killed at some point, and we're so far detached, aren't we, as we all know, from the slaughtering process, that actually, for me, maybe that's a challenge not a need to pay.

NOTE: BARNEY, VIC, AND DAN DISCUSS ABOUT THE KILLING OF THE IGUANA, AND BARNEY TAKES A STEP UP TO TRY TO DO IT

2484.56 2488.56 VIC: If you kill it, will you have repercussions, sleepless nights?
2489.56 2490.56 VIC: Nobody!
2490.56 2491.56 VIC: I don't give a...
2492.56 2493.56 VIC: Blood gushing, stinking...
2494.56 2495.56 VIC: Let's put this in perspective.
2496.56 2498.56 BARNEY: I've been a paramedic for four years and since you've done nasty things,
2499.56 2502.56 BARNEY: but I think I'd like to test myself. Do it.
2503.56 2504.56 VIC: Don't do an Aussie Osborne and bite its head off, though.
2511.56 2512.56 DAN: BARNEY how you feeling?
2513.56 2519.56 BARNEY: It suddenly feels much more real when you're having to sit here like the executioner, you know.
2520.56 2521.56 BARNEY: It's a bit...
2524.56 2526.56 BARNEY: I can't tell you a part of death.
2527.56 2528.56 BARNEY: It goes right over, doesn't it?
2529.56 2530.56 BARNEY Like this.
2533.56 2535.56 WILL: Let's do it. I was going to get in.
2536.56 2537.56 DAN: Bring him down here.
2538.56 2539.56 WILL: Woof.
2540.56 2541.56 BARNEY: You got him?
2542.56 2543.56 WILL: Yeah.
2544.56 2547.56 BARNEY: Yeah, so if you're able to hold his head down, actually...
2551.56 2552.56 BARNEY: Spot on.
2553.56 2554.56 BARNEY: I think you're about to provide.
2559.56 2560.56 ROSS: Great effort, Barney.
2561.56 2562.56 ROSS: Hold on, Barney.
2563.56 2564.56 DAN: You alright mate?
2565.56 2566.56 BARNEY: Yeah.
2567.56 2571.56 BARNEY: A couple of my really close friends have got iguanas, and I really don't know how they'll view this.
2572.56 2577.56 BARNEY: I hope they understand that this is completely a survival situation, and their pets are not in danger.


note: Everyone is surprised barney went through with the kill and is impressed
	+dan, vic, will has greater respect for barney
2577.56 2580.56 BARNEY: They can leave me in the lounge without them.
2583.56 2588.56 BARNEY: It's a very mix of emotions, because you really have provided, and everyone's got some food tonight, including myself.
2589.56 2595.56 BARNEY: Hopefully it gives you a greater respect for the animal than if I were just to sit round tonight having somebody else killed it.
2596.56 2598.56 BARNEY: I'm going to enjoy that meal more than anyone tonight.

2600.56 2612.56 HOST:  I've seen it myself so often, you know, the quiet, humble individual, who the group may be initially discount, but suddenly they can become the man of the hour, just in one heroic moment.
2613.56 2615.56 HOST:  And these brave people earn respect through their deeds.
2616.56 2618.56 HOST:  They don't earn it through, you know, bluster.
2619.56 2621.56 HOST:  And really, that's what British courage is.

2622.56 2623.56 None  There you go!
2628.56 2632.56 HOST:  After a week on the island, the men can finally sit down to a decent meal.
2632.56 2633.56 BARNEY:  Looks like proper food

.
2634.56 2635.56 BARNEY: Isn't that just an incredible sight?
2636.56 2638.56 ROSS: Yeah, and it's caramelising outside, it'd be beautiful.
2639.56 2640.56 DAN: This is going to be like...
2641.56 2642.56 DAN: Is he eating his own neck?
2643.56 2644.56 PHIL: Yeah.
2645.56 2646.56 PHIL: That's just sick, Barney.
2647.56 2650.56 PHIL: They do say that Mother Nature watches what you do, and if you work hard enough, she rewards you.
2651.56 2652.56 PHIL: Today she did.
2653.56 2654.56 VIC: Good job, Barney.
2655.56 2656.56 VIC: Here you go, guys. Well done and congratulations.
2657.56 2658.56 VIC: Well done, teens.
2659.56 2660.56 VIC: Ocean 11's us.
2661.56 2662.56 VIC: Yes!

Note: everyone is cheering when they are cooking the animal, all are impressed and clapping for barney doing the kill (+1 from all to barney)

2663.56 2664.56 BARNEY: Let's have a little taste, pass it on.
2665.56 2666.56 PIERS: What's delicious?
2667.56 2668.56 BARNEY: So good.
2669.56 2672.56 ROSS: The first time of eating something, which is ridiculously, amazingly brilliant.
2673.56 2674.56 DAN: Oh, it's like a good piece, Barney?
2675.56 2676.56 BARNEY: Yes, it is, Mason.
2677.56 2678.56 FARMAR:  There's more meat on this than I thought.
2679.56 2680.56 FARMAR:  Tilt, tilt.
2681.56 2687.56 WILL: Eleven were sitting around a caveman, just gnawing and slurping and chewing and staring into the flames.
2688.56 2689.56 WILL: Great.
2690.56 2692.56 WILL: Even though he literally cut his face in two.
2693.56 2694.56 BARNEY: There you go.
2695.56 2697.56 BARNEY: Feeling increasingly manly as the day goes on.
2698.56 2699.56 BARNEY: See what it brings the green.
2700.56 2701.56 BARNEY: All feels worthwhile.
2702.56 2703.56 WILL: No complaints with this at all.
2704.56 2705.56 WILL: I think your head might be my favourite bit.
2708.56 2714.56 HOST:  With food in their stomachs, the men's thoughts turn to Andy's unoccupied bed, which is now up for grabs.
2715.56 2716.56 PAUL: No wanking in the individual bed, please.
2717.56 2718.56 WILL: Okay, I've completely misunderstood what it's for.
2719.56 2721.56 WILL: Is anyone not want out here?
2722.56 2727.56 CHARLIE: Dude, after the third night, every morning, I woke up, I'm prouder than the honeymooner, though.
2728.56 2731.56 CHARLIE: Seriously, you could want like a single man A-frame, come see me in the morning.

Note: all in group are bonding around the fire eating, and talking about who should take the newly built bread that andy left behind (+1 all direction)

2733.56 2734.56 None  Buzzing tonight. Buzzing.
2736.56 2742.56 ROSS: I feel like a bunch of 11 mates sat around a campfire, on a wee holiday, eating great food.
2743.56 2745.56 ROSS:: Fantastic 14 is now the excellent 11.
2745.56 2748.56 ROSS: I'm not a nor illusion that shit tanks will come, but if it needs time, they'll embrace the good,
2749.56 2752.56 ROSS: and the good. It's right now.
