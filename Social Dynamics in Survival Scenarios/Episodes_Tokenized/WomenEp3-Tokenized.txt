0.00 34.72 HOST: Two uninhabited Pacific Islands. More than 5,000 miles from the UK. One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British women. For six weeks they'll be utterly alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools. Filming everything themselves. When pushed to the limits of human endurance.

34.72 48.96 HOST: So thin now. Will it be brute power or mental strength? The winds of day. Watch him, watch him, go now, go now. Who will have what it takes to stay alive? Tonight we follow the women's island.

48.96 55.96 GEORGIE:  Oh my God, that's game. Oh my God. Survival will be hard to see. It's

57.72 64.72 HOST: harder than ever. They'll have to make fire, hunt for food and find water. Living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season.

67.00 81.92 HOST:  I'm still wet, worse night's sleep. I surely am more dicey. Hang on. Oh shit. 
81.92 88.92 HOST: When pitted against the extremes of nature, have these Monday women got what it takes to survive? 
93.32 100.32 SPEAKER_14  Just remember to how you felt when you felt shit and leave it there. 
100.32 107.32 HOST: It's been seven days since 14 British women were marooned on a
remote Pacific island. 

116.76 123.76 JAMIE: What? A huge fucking king's put me. It's my fucking leg. 

HOST: Brutal conditions have already claimed two victims. I need to go. I need to be with my family.
123.76 129.08 HOST: And the group paid the price when they split to find a sustainable water source. 
129.08 136.84 JAMIE: We cannot walk anywhere on this island without getting lost. Radio in now. Magic now. Hello. 

137.84 149.28 HOST: Finally reunited after three days apart. I can't believe it. The women find themselves on the northern tip of the island. They have no water source and many haven't had a drop to drink for two days

<INTRO END>

149.28 156.28 CHAVALI: Yo, dudes. Hi. It's sunny. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the
159.08 179.20 CHAVALI:  beach. The sun is blaring so hot. There is no outside input and it is up to us to survive and thrive. That is a heck of a challenge. Oh my gosh. 

HOST: Despite the oppressive 30 degree heat, there's something to celebrate for one of the party. 

180.44 196.08 SPEAKER_15  Happy birthday dear. Happy birthday dear. Happy birthday. If you'd asked me a year ago where I'd be spending my 25th birthday,

NOTE: THE GIRLS ARE CELEBRATING LAURENS 25TH BIRTHDAY (+1)

196.68 208.16 LAUREN: I definitely would not have been saying, oh my 25th birthday will be spent abandoned on an island, dehydrated and starving. 

208.92 215.92 HOST: For the last five days, the women have barely eaten and had hardly anything to drink. Finding water is a priority. 

216.92 228.44 CHAVALI: I just want to drink. The only reason we're not thinking about food is because we're so thirsty. 

FRAN: Our body basically tries and likes to compensate for everything that we're lacking. 

228.44 243.72 HOST: When it comes to survival, I often talk about the rule of three, which means you can survive three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food. And in temperatures like this, the women have got to drink a lot between two and four liters of water a day. If they are finished.

244.04 251.04 JAMIE: That is a clear blue sky. The sun obviously makes you feel more dehydrated and more weak.

252.52 266.24 HOST: Without a sustainable water source, they're surviving on rainwater, but there hasn't been a drop for 48 hours. 

266.24 273.24 JAMIE: Looking at the sea, you just want to drink the sea water or keep dreaming about diet iron brew. Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold,freezing cold, diet iron brew with ice

274.36 310.72 LAUREN:. Oh my God, my other birthday is when I'm stressing out because no one's got me a card or no one's come out for a meal and now I'm just going to be happy with a piece of fruit and some water. I think a bogey just came out of my nose. Eighty eight! Waste nothing! I've always loved adventure. I've always loved adventure. In December 2013, I set off on transatlantic rowing race, 3,000 miles across  to Antiguan. 

310.72 317.72 LAUREN: The 30th of January and we have just had a cap of size. I have split my head open.

317.96 336.44 LAUREN:  I didn't want to give up. It's been 96 days of pushing my body and pushing my mind further than I ever had before, but we still had to give up. So that's how to come to terms with I will not get off the island. I have to prove to myself that I can do it.
NOTE: JAMIE IS SAYING LAUREN IS KEEPING EVERYONE SANE (+1)  WROTE HER A BIRTHDAY MESSAGE
336.44 343.44 LAUREN:  Happy birthday Lauren, superwoman. She's keeping us all sane. She's keeping us all sane. 

346.40 352.88 HOST: Celebrations are short lived. The women have a life or death priority. 
352.88 359.88 BELINDA:Seeing the effect that dehydration has, I couldn't really have predicted that it could be so disabling. 

Georgie: We're not coming  back until we've found water. There are no pools, which is what we're after.

362.48 387.84  HOST: Georgie leads a group on a scouting mission into the thick jungle. I've made sure that the island's got enough water, indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive, but only if they've got the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill it. 

GEORGIE: That's quite a deep pool, it's empty.

389.84 396.84 BETH: It's just the same shit. If we don't find water, we're screwed.

BELINDA:  What is that? 

400.12 407.12 JAMIE: Oh my god, there's two peglets. Oh my god. Oh my god. Be careful because it's mum's neck.

411.24 425.64 JAMIE: I can actually see mum over here. 

BELINDA: Oh, careful. Come away. If mum thinks the kids are threatened, that's when they get really aggressive. 

JAMIE:She's lying down. 

BELINDA: Come away sweetheart. 

JAMIE:She's massive, She's enormous. She's like really near.

426.32 440.36 BETH. The piglets, the first thing I thought of was crackling to be honest. I am hungry. I don't think I could look into his little piggy eyes and then kill him.

441.84 453.84 BETH  I'm not ready for that yet. But then again, by the time I come home, I'll probably be a full blown fucking, I don't know, cannibal. 

453.84 460.84 HOST: The pigs are given a reprieve. Right now, everyone's lives depend on finding water. 

JAMIE: What are we going to do? Let's go.

461.84 464.84 SPEAKER_15  Sit down.
471.84 476.84 FRAN: We're all buggered. No energy to move.
NOTE: FRAN CONFIDES IN ABBY ABOUT HER PROBLEMS WITH DEHYDRATION
476.84 483.84 ABBY:  Fran. You're all right. I'm okay. What's wrong? Whenever I stand up, I just see your blood.
485.84 492.84 ABBY: That's dehydration, babe. 

HOST: The situation is now critical. 

GEORGIE: We're going foraging. Water.

493.84 496.84 HOST: In a do or die attempt to find water.
497.84 502.84 HOST: Georgie and Fi strike out in the midday sun.
504.84 511.84 GEORGIE:  I just think I just couldn't sit and wilt in that sun down there.

513.84 520.84 HOST: The weather here is brutal. You know, you've got 90% plus humidity. The heat here is oppressive.
521.84 528.84 HOST: So finding that fresh water source is vital. The bottom line is you go three days without it, you're dead.

531.84 534.84 FI: So fucking low. So hot.
538.84 541.84 GEORGIE: I'm being in a microwave.
545.84 548.84 FI: I think we should look on here and then go back.
551.84 553.84 GEORGIE: I feel my heart beating Really fast.

555.84 559.84 GEORGIE: Ooh. How'd it work? It's water.

NOTE: FI AND GEORGIE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO FIND WATER (+1) THEY SUCCESSFULLY FOUND WATER AND THEY HIGH FIVE, RELIEVED


560.84 565.84 FI: Ah, this looks good. Jesus Christ! We did it! Oh, yeah, baby.
566.84 569.84 FI: I don't give a fuck where that came from. Yeah, what are you drinking? Oh. Amazing.

572.84 578.84 GEORGIE:: So we hit the jackpot and picked this out.
581.84 586.84 GEORGIE:  OK, it's not over yet. You know what? If I die, I don't care.
587.84 589.84 FI: At leat I don't die thirsty.

593.84 596.84 HOST: Obviously, rain itself is drinkable without purification.
597.84 603.84 HOST: But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated. All sorts of bacteria is a nasty scare.
604.84 607.84 HOST: And no matter how clean the water looks, you've got to boil it.

NOTE: EVERYONE IS HAPPY ABOUT WATER, BUT THE WATER IS NOT FULLY CLEAN (+0.5), AND UNSURE ABOUT IT WITHOUT BOILING FIRST

607.84 611.84 GEORGIE: Guess what I've got? Water! Yeah!
612.84 615.84 GEORGIE: I'm not going to lie to you. You drink it at your own risk.

618.84 622.84 BELINDA: Don't drink it.
It came from a waterfall and it tastes fine. 
623.84 627.84 BELINDA: Every waterfall, river, whatever, has to be filtered and boiled.
629.84 633.84 BELINDA: Because of the parasites, it's just a death trap.
633.84 636.84 BELINDA: Complete. The whole island is a death trap.
637.84 639.84 ABBY: The thing is, then, we need to get this fire started.
639.84 641.84 ABBY: Because if we don't get this fire started, we're back to zero again.
641.84 643.84 ABBY: We're back to no fucking water.


646.84 649.84 HOST: They haven't been able to start a fire for three days.
649.84 652.84 HOST: If they're to survive, this is their last chance.

653.84 658.84 LAUREN: I won't stop until the fire is ready. Because then I know that we can drink.

NOTE: LAUREN, GEORGIE AND BETH ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE A FIRE (+1), EVERYONE IS HAPPY THAT IT IS SUCESSFUL

659.84 662.84 JAMIE: Just go through that smoke, pretend it's not even smoking.
662.84 665.84 ABBY: I think we've got it. I think we've got it. Go, stop.
668.84 670.84 SPEAKER_15  It looks really hard. It's got enough...
670.84 672.84 SPEAKER_15  That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.
673.84 676.84 SPEAKER_15  Well done, guys! We've got a fire!
676.84 679.84 SPEAKER_15  Well done, girls!
681.84 683.84 CHAVALA: We just taste the water.

685.84 688.84 JAMIE: Look at that fire.

688.84 692.84 HOST: The water won't be safe to drink until it is boiled some three hours later.
692.84 695.84 HOST: Meanwhile, Lauren's keeping the fire going.

NOTE: LAUREN IS KEEPING THE FIRE GOING, EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SHE IS DOING A LOT OF THE WORK (+1)

695.84 698.84 LAUREN: The fire is so hot, it's burning through everything.
699.84 704.84 JAMIE: The BIRTHDAY girl is doing all the hard work and she's exhausted.

NOTE: JAMIE IS PROUD OF LAUREN
NOTE: BEKI LIKES LAUREN AND BETH FOR TAKING LEADERSHIP

704.84 710.84 BEKI: I'd say that Lauren and Beth are always first in there to help.
710.84 712.84 FI: also they think of things.

712.84 715.84 SPEAKER_21  No! No! No!
715.84 718.84 SPEAKER_02  Oh, shit! Lauren, Lauren, come this way, this way, this way.
718.84 721.84 JAMIE: Go to the sea now. Fucking hell.
721.84 725.84 JAMIE:  Shit. She opened the lid and it just exported in our face.
725.84 728.84 JAMIE:   Oh, fuck. Right in there, babe.
728.84 731.84 JAMIE:   Get her right immersed in the sea.
731.84 733.84 SPEAKER_02  Jesus! Oh, fuck.
736.84 739.84 SPEAKER_02  Oh, shit! Lauren, Lauren, come this way, this way, this way.
739.84 741.84 SPEAKER_02  Go to the sea now.
741.84 743.84 SPEAKER_02  Go right into the sea because it's cold.

743.84 748.84 HOST: Day seven on the island and Lauren's been tending a jerrycan of boiling water on the fire.



748.84 751.84 JAMIE:  She opened the lid and it just exported in our face.
751.84 754.84 GEORGIE: Jesus! What happened? What happened?
754.84 757.84 GEORGINA: The pressure of the jerrycans exploded.

NOTE: BELINDA: IS WORRIED FOR LAUREN, ASKING HER HOW SHE IS, AND IS USING HER DOCTOR BACKGROUND

757.84 759.84 BELINDA: How are you feeling?
759.84 760.84 LAUREN: Fine.
760.84 764.84 BELINDA: OK. Stay there for now, keep in the water.

764.84 768.84 HOST: For the moment, Dr BELINDA: can't tell how badly scolded Lauren is.

768.84 771.84 BELINDA: What you say is to run whatever it is under cold water.
771.84 775.84 BELINDA:  Exactly. We'll see the extent of it and on the net.
775.84 778.84 FRAN: Just everything seems to be going tipsy turney.
778.84 780.84 FRAN: It's just everything.
780.84 783.84 FRAN: She's going to blow it up. One of our strongest people.
783.84 787.84 FRAN: So if she goes down, I think it'd be a big debt to her.

NOTE: FRAN IS WORRIED FOR LAUREN, AND SAYS SHE IS THE STRONGEST PEOPLE OF THE GROUP

787.84 790.84 JULIE: It's like doing your water on your engine.
790.84 795.84 JULIE: You've got to let it cool down before you open the top screw top.

795.84 799.84 HOST: If her burns prove to be severe, Lauren may have to be evacuated.

799.84 805.84 GEORGINA:  Poor Lauren. She's not having the best birthday, I believe she dehydrated and she's scolded by boiling water.

805.84 808.84 BELINDA: I'm just going to keep dampening you and letting it cool.

NOTE: GEORGINA ALSO IS WORRIED FOR LAUREN AND WANTS HER TO RECOVER

808.84 811.84 GEORGINA: Hopefully she will be back to full strength soon.
811.84 817.84 HOST: Lauren's face isn't scolded and Dr BELINDA: believes she can treat the burns on her arm.
817.84 820.84 BELINDA: Pressure in the blistered area. That's the worst bit.
821.84 826.84 LAUREN: It feels like someone is singeing my arm with a hot poker.
826.84 835.84 LAUREN: I will not let people see that I'm feeling just as weak as them because I actually feel like some people need strength in other people to keep them going.
835.84 838.84 LAUREN: And I'm determined to be that person.
838.84 841.84 LAUREN:  Hello! I'm still standing.

847.84 853.84 HOST: Despite the jerrycan exploding, just enough water remains for everyone to have a life-saving drink.

NOTE: JULIE AND ABBY ARE BICKERING ABOUT WATER BOTTLES

853.84 856.84 JULIE: Pick your own bottle, after all the same.
856.84 859.84 JULIE: Um, you just used it.
859.84 861.84 ABBY: No, I asked for a whiskey and coke.
861.84 868.84 JAMIE:_05  Oh, I've went for some Aloe Vera original drink and Aloe Vera is disgusting.
868.84 872.84 JAMIE: I tried it with a detox and it tastes like spam.
880.84 882.84 JAMIE: There's a pig. Pig, there.
882.84 884.84 GEORGINA: Oh, yeah.

884.84 888.84 HOST: Now they have a water source, food should be the women's big priority.
888.84 890.84 GEORGIE:  Beep, beep, beep, beep.
890.84 892.84 SPEAKER_15  Hello.
892.84 896.84 HOST: All they've eaten in a week are a few handfuls of yucca and coconut.

897.84 900.84 JAMIE: We've got two of the cutest little piglets here.
900.84 902.84 JAMIE: They're little tails wag like dogs, they're so cute.
902.84 904.84 CHAVALA Aah!

904.84 910.84 HOST:  Everything that moves on that island really should be seen as a potential source of food, and that includes the pigs.

910.84 914.84 SPEAKER_15  Oh, you're so cute. Come here, sage.
914.84 916.84 SPEAKER_15  Onion.
916.84 918.84 SPEAKER_15  Oh!

918.84 923.84 HOST: To befriend them is just going to make the decision to kill them a thousand times more difficult.
923.84 926.84 HOST: And really, in survival, there's no room for sentiment.

926.84 929.84 LAUREN:  Sorry, I'm just being joined here.
929.84 933.84 LAUREN: I can hear you squeaking. What are you squeaking about?
933.84 936.84 LAUREN:  Everyone's like, oh, they're so cute.
936.84 939.84 LAUREN:  They're so cute. You're going to eat with those pets.
939.84 941.84 LAUREN:  I'm just thinking, you know, fuck that girl.
941.84 944.84 LAUREN:  We're literally going to slice and dice those piggies.
944.84 947.84 LAUREN:  Definitely, we're eating them.
947.84 950.84 LAUREN:  Suckling pig.
950.84 951.84 SPEAKER_19  Nah.

NOTE: BELINDA: AND ABBY ARE DISAGREEING ABOUT EATING THE PIGLETS
	JAMIE ALSO WANTS TO EAT THE PIG

951.84 954.84 SPEAKER_14  Would you not eat them? No, they're so cute.

954.84 955.84 ABBY: I don't care that they're cute.
955.84 963.84 JAMIE: As the time goes on, we'll be hungrier and hungrier, but I am not killing the little piglets and eating them.
963.84 965.84 JAMIE: No way.
965.84 967.84 JAMIE: They're so funny.
967.84 969.84 None  Aah!

969.84 973.84 JAMIE: I've been a vegetarian basically since I was born.
973.84 980.84 JAMIE: I think it's going to be a massive challenge if I have to, by choice, eat meat.
980.84 988.84 JAMIE: But then again, maybe it's not going to be a choice because I'll be so starving and I'll just have to eat it.
988.84 993.84 JAMIE: I would definitely say I'm an animal person rather than a people's person.
993.84 996.84 JAMIE: You know, animals are less stressful sometimes.
996.84 1000.84 JAMIE: I will train them pigs. I'll kick them up the arse.

1002.84 1012.84 BETH:  The moral argument is, is do we now eat the pigs? But then do you kill essentially your pet?
1012.84 1014.84 GEORGIE: Piggy, biggies.
1014.84 1017.84 GEORGIE:  Sagey, onion.

1022.84 1025.84 HOST: With water running low…

1025.84 1029.84 BELINDA: Careful, these rocks are uber fucking slippy.

1029.84 1033.84 HOST: An expedition party makes a hazardous journey back to the waterfall.

NOTE: BELINDA:, JAMIE, GEORGIE ARE WORKING TO FIND MORE WATER , FRAN, ABBY TOO

1033.84 1035.84 GEORGIE: That's it, guys. We're nearly there.
1036.84 1038.84 GEORGIE:  Jamie, hang on.
1038.84 1040.84 GEORGIE:  Oh!
1040.84 1043.84 SPEAKER_02  Shit. I saved the camera!
1043.84 1045.84 GEORGIE:  Good job.
1049.84 1051.84 GEORGIE:  That's it, there.
1053.84 1055.84 GEORGIE:  Shit doesn't look like it's running.
1055.84 1057.84 GEORGIE:  For fuck's sake.
1057.84 1058.84 GEORGIE:  No!
1058.84 1062.84 GEORGIE:  Hold on, Stank. This was pouring with water the other day.
1062.84 1064.84 GEORGIE:  And it's dry.
1065.84 1067.84 GEORGIE:  Tall with...
1067.84 1069.84 BETH:  Baa!

1074.84 1081.84 HOST: The water source may be dry, but fortunately in the tropics, the weather can change in an instant.

1082.84 1084.84 ABBY: Look at that.
1086.84 1089.84 ABBY: It seems such a dirty, grey cloud, is that?

1091.84 1094.84 JAMIE: Oh, here it comes!
1094.84 1096.84 SPEAKER_07  Let's get water.
1098.84 1101.84 SPEAKER_07  Can you pass me the bottle one by one and pass them over to me?


1101.84 1108.84 HOST: Violent Pacific storms can dampen into water in an hour, but women need to take their chances when they can.


1108.84 1110.84 JAMIE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
1110.84 1112.84 JAMIE: We need time to protect the fire!
1112.84 1114.84 JAMIE: The woods getting saturated.

1114.84 1121.84 HOST: They're using Georgie's poncho to save the fire, but half the group is tied up trying to collect rainwater.

1121.84 1123.84 FI: I  cant fucking believe this.
1123.84 1125.84 FI: How could this organise, can they be?
1125.84 1127.84 SPEAKER_20  Oh, I know, Piggy!
1127.84 1130.84 SPEAKER_19  Oi! Oh, they're getting sheltered.
1131.84 1133.84 SPEAKER_19  It's cooking itself, really.
1133.84 1136.84 SPEAKER_19 Let them roast themselves

1138.84 1140.84 JAMIE: Is that tornado?
1140.84 1142.84 JAMIE: Wow.
1142.84 1144.84 JAMIE: You want to see what's out there, girls?
1144.84 1145.84 JAMIE: What?
1145.84 1147.84 JAMIE: It's like a big bang in the sky.
1147.84 1150.84 JAMIE: Honestly, I've never seen it in like anything.
1150.84 1152.84 GEORGIE: If that touches down, we're in trouble.
1152.84 1153.84 JAMIE: Oh, my God.

1153.84 1158.84 HOST: At their worst, water tornadoes are capable of travelling up to 150 miles an hour.
1158.84 1162.84 HOST: If this hits the island, it could destroy everything in its path.
1162.84 1164.84 GEORGINA:  It's like one of those.
1164.84 1167.84 BELINDA:  It's growing as well. It is growing.
1167.84 1169.84 GEORGINA: Well, that's pretty scary.
1169.84 1172.84 GEORGINA: No, we've already run up there and no-one can get through anything like that.
1172.84 1174.84 GEORGINA: It's full-hand on.
1174.84 1177.84 GEORGINA: Is it dissipating or is it just curving?

1182.84 1186.84 JAMIE:  Its just slipped off,.
1186.84 1188.84 GEORGIE: We get to live another day Shame.

1191.84 1196.84 HOST: While they've kept the fire alight, they've hardly collected any water.

NOTE: THEY KEPT THE FIRE ALIVE (0.5) BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET ENOUGH WATER DURING THE RAIN

1196.84 1199.84 SPEAKER_14  Was that the total amount of what we've just got through the rain form?
1199.84 1201.84  BEKI: Yeah.
1202.84 1204.84 BEKI: I am struggling.
1204.84 1209.84  BEKI: But as much as we nest here, Mother Nature turns up and she just shits on it.
1210.84 1213.84  BEKI: And it's like a fucking mudslide everywhere now.

1213.84 1217.84 HOST: It's become clear to the women they can't survive here on Coconut Beach.
1217.84 1219.84 HOST: They must move camp.
1220.84 1227.84 HOST: Five days ago, the women discovered a beach on the western side of the island with a sustainable water source nearby.
1227.84 1229.84 HOST: They christened it Home Beach.
1229.84 1232.84 HOST: Now Lauren wants to take everyone back there.

1232.84 1234.84 LAUREN: You need to get to that home beach now.
1234.84 1237.84 LAUREN: The beach, the water...
1238.84 1241.84 LAUREN: It's just going to make people feel like they can actually do this.
1244.84 1247.84 LAUREN: I'm pretty confident in where that beach is.

NOTE: LAUREN RECOMMENDS TO MOVE LOCATIONS, GEORGIE GREES, CHAVALI ALSO AGREES, 

1247.84 1249.84 GEORGIE:  We do have a serious problem with water.
1249.84 1251.84 GEORGIE:  Hopefully Home Beach is going to sort all that out.
1251.84 1253.84 LAUREN: There's a stream there.
1253.84 1255.84 LAUREN: Yeah, and it's just the resources.
1255.84 1257.84 LAUREN: We can start making our shelters.
1257.84 1259.84 LAUREN: You guys haven't seen it yet either, have you?
1259.84 1272.84 CHAVALI: So I've got this image of this beach that flows for like miles, palm trees, hammocks, shelter, waterfalls, fish jumping from the sea.
1272.84 1274.84 BELINDA: Yeah, we saw that. We didn't see that.
1274.84 1276.84  CHAVALI: Oh, I'm so excited.
1276.84 1278.84  CHAVALI: What's the plan with the fire guys?
1278.84 1280.84  CHAVALI: It's going to transport it.
1280.84 1282.84 FI: You haven't got anything metal, have we, yet?
1282.84 1284.84 FI: So we'll just have to light another one.
1284.84 1285.84 LAUREN: So we're experts now.
1285.84 1286.84 LAUREN: I'm excited.
1286.84 1287.84 LAUREN: I think it's going to be eight.
1287.84 1289.84 LAUREN: Who would like the first snail?
1289.84 1292.84 LAUREN: Oh!

1293.84 1296.84 HOST: Sage and onion remain off the menu.
1296.84 1298.84 HOST: Tonight is just foraged snails.

1298.84 1306.84 SPEAKER_20  It tastes quite salty, quite meaty, and then there's this sharp like shit, basically.

1307.84 1311.84 HOST: And a good meal always prompts a lively conversation.
1311.84 1312.84 HOST: Is that it?

1312.84 1313.84 JAMIE: That's it.
1313.84 1314.84 JAMIE: It's small.
1314.84 1317.84 JAMIE: I had this over here with the tiny little penis.
1317.84 1321.84 JAMIE: It's definitely a micro penis because it was smaller than my pinky.
1321.84 1322.84 JAMIE: It's like…

NOTE: BELINDA: TALKING ABOUT A SELF STORY, AND PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING
	BETH, JAMIE, JULIE, GEORGIE ARE PARTICULARLY AMUSED

1322.84 1324.84 BETH:  It was so small!
1324.84 1327.84 BELINDA: Seriously, Beth? It's not even funny.
1328.84 1332.84 BELINDA: I really feel for them because no girl could feel that inside them.
1332.84 1333.84 BELINDA: Can you imagine?
1333.84 1334.84 BELINDA:  So far, how take you were.
1334.84 1335.84 BELINDA:  So what's the point?
1335.84 1339.84 BELINDA:  One guy who I was dating, it just felt like a little twiglet.
1339.84 1343.84 BELINDA:  The good thing is that they're often really good at coming lingers.
1345.84 1351.84 BELINDA:  And then you have to get special condoms because they're so small and it's just going to slip off otherwise.
1351.84 1354.84 JAMIE: So, yeah, I actually get special condoms for them.
1354.84 1356.84 BELINDA: You can, yeah.

1357.84 1360.84 HOST: 6.30am, day nine.

1361.84 1363.84 SPEAKER_10  Oh, it's so pretty.
1363.84 1364.84 None  Oh, it's so pretty.
1364.84 1366.84 SPEAKER_10  I've just seen it all.
1366.84 1367.84 SPEAKER_10  All night.
1367.84 1368.84 SPEAKER_10  Honestly adorable.
1368.84 1372.84 FI:   And since that pig, they're very cute.
1372.84 1374.84 BELINDA: It's slightly happy.

1375.84 1381.84 HOST: Today, the women face an arduous trek, seeking the beach where they want to build a permanent camp.

NOTE: JULIE ASKS ABOUT BRINING COCONUTS TO THE NEW CAMP, AND GEORGIE SAYS ITS DOESN’T MAKE SENSE TO DO IT, AND SHE IS NOT HAPPY

1381.84 1383.84 JULIE: What do you think, Jamie?
1383.84 1387.84 JULIE:  It's a bit of crackling as they get a mouthful of coconut before we set off.
1387.84 1388.84 JULIE: No.
1388.84 1390.84 GEORGIE: No, too heavy to slow, sir.
1390.84 1392.84 JAMIE: Oh, I really want a coconut.
1392.84 1393.84 JAMIE: I'm so hungry.
1393.84 1396.84 JULIE: I'm so hungry, someone's just said now.
1397.84 1400.84 JULIE: I want you to just take your backpack off and I'm going to give it to Jamie.
1400.84 1403.84 JULIE: It's a hard walk and you will find it difficult.

1403.84 1410.84 HOST: With very little water for the trek, Abby and BELINDA: are especially concerned about PhD student Fran.

NOTE: ABBY AND BELINDA: ARE CONCERNED FOR FRAN

1410.84 1411.84 ABBY: No, she's not well
1411.84 1413.84 ABBY: She doesn't want to make a person.
1413.84 1414.84 ABBY: She doesn't want to make a person.
1414.84 1415.84 ABBY: She doesn't want to make a person.
1415.84 1416.84 ABBY: I said she's not well.

1416.84 1420.84 HOST: Five days ago, she collapsed and received emergency medical treatment.

1420.84 1422.84 BELINDA: I'm really worried about Fran.
1422.84 1426.84 BELINDA: Every time she tries to do something, she's feeling lightheaded and dizzy.
1426.84 1433.84 BELINDA:  She's already passed that once due to low blood sugar, so clearly her body's not very good at adapting to this.
1433.84 1436.84 BELINDA:  Shall we make you the bow carrier?
1436.84 1439.84 GEORGIE:  This is actually the most important thing ever.
1439.84 1446.84 FRAN: I feel like the weakest person in the group, because even though they're really tired, they can keep going.
1446.84 1449.84 FRAN: As I've said before, I just feel like another mouth to feed.
1451.84 1452.84 None  Nice.
1452.84 1454.84 FRAN: Oh, no. No. Nice.

1454.84 1457.84 HOST: CHAVALA is reluctant to leave Sage and Onion behind.

1458.84 1459.84 SPEAKER_15  Oh!
1459.84 1461.84 SPEAKER_15  Oh, no, he's tangled on him.
1461.84 1463.84 JAMIE: No, we're OK. We'll just grab him.
1463.84 1466.84 JAMIE: The wild animals, they just need to be left alone.
1466.84 1468.84 JAMIE: I wanted to try.
1468.84 1470.84 CHAVALA: We can't take the pigs.

1472.84 1474.84 SPEAKER_22  Guys, we're going to Homebeat.
1474.84 1476.84 SPEAKER_22  Whoo!
1477.84 1480.84 SPEAKER_22  Bye, Sage. Bye, Onion.
1480.84 1482.84 SPEAKER_22  Bye, Dinner. Bye, Lan.
1484.84 1486.84 GEORGIE:  Look at us. We look like savannahs.
1486.84 1487.84 SPEAKER_22  The babbo's.

1492.84 1495.84 HOST: 9am, the women depart for Home Beach.
1495.84 1500.84 HOST: The last time they went into the jungle, they were lost for three days.

1502.84 1504.84 SPEAKER_14  We're going down, Lauren.

NOTE: LAUREN TAKES CHARGE OF LEADING THE GROUP

1504.84 1508.84 HOST: This time, 25-year-old nurse Lauren leads away.
1508.84 1511.84 LAUREN: Then we're just going to light a head on this ridge thing.
1511.84 1513.84 LAUREN: Julie, how are you feeling?



1513.84 1514.84 JULIE: Fuck off.
1514.84 1515.84 LAUREN: Fuck off?
1515.84 1517.84 JULIE: Yeah, I'm feeling.
1517.84 1519.84 LAUREN: Whoo!

1522.84 1525.84 HOST: After just half an hour, Becky's in trouble.
1525.84 1528.84 BEKI: Hold up, guys. It's got a dry mouth.
1529.84 1532.84 BEKI: My water bottle allocation for the day is almost done.
1532.84 1533.84 BEKI: How's everyone doing?
1533.84 1536.84 JAMIE: Energy levels zero.

1537.84 1544.84 HOST: The move will eat into the women's fragile energy reserves, but it's a gamble they must take, whatever the consequences.

1544.84 1546.84 LAUREN: Take five.
1546.84 1548.84 FRAN: Thank you.
1549.84 1553.84 FRAN: If this rain keeps on going, I feel like I'm on the brink of collapsing again.
1553.84 1557.84 FRAN: I don't want to tell anyone because I feel so pathetic.
1557.84 1559.84 FRAN: I know I can do this.
1559.84 1562.84 FRAN: I just need to keep going.

1563.84 1568.84 HOST: With the group exhausted, Lauren and Fi volunteer to scout ahead.
NOTE: LAUREN AND FI SCOUT AHEAD WHILE THE REST OF THE GROUP TAKE A BREAK (+1)

1568.84 1570.84 JULIE: Anyone want a biscuit?
1570.84 1573.84 ABBY: Oh, you bitch.
1573.84 1575.84 GEORGINA: Just a little bob.

1581.84 1584.84 HOST: The advance party are pushing ahead through the jungle.

1584.84 1586.84 LAUREN: I think we may have found it.
1587.84 1589.84 FI: We have! This is it!
1589.84 1592.84 FI: I know. This is our beach.
1596.84 1599.84 LAUREN: Oh, my God. So excited.
1599.84 1601.84 FI:  I feel a surge of energy.
1602.84 1604.84 LAUREN: I can hear the sea!
1605.84 1607.84 LAUREN Oh, wow.
1607.84 1610.84 LAUREN: That is amazing.
1616.84 1617.84 None  Look at that!

NOTE: THE GROUP IS SUCCESSFUL TO MAKING IT TO THE GROUP (+1)

1617.84 1621.84 LAUREN: Even in the pisto drain, the space looks ridiculous.
1621.84 1625.84 ABBY: I just think paradise compared to where we've been, the sea looks bluer.
1625.84 1627.84 ABBY: Everything looks better. Everything.
1627.84 1630.84 SPEAKER_14  Our pigs! The pigs!
1630.84 1632.84 SPEAKER_15  Yay!
1632.84 1635.84 ABBY:  They've traipsed all that way after us.
1635.84 1637.84 ABBY: I don't know whether I could eat them now.
1637.84 1639.84 ABBY: Aww.
1641.84 1643.84 JAMIE: Why the king? He love us.
1648.84 1649.84 LAUREN: What the hell?
1649.84 1651.84 LAUREN: Ketchup.
1652.84 1656.84 LAUREN: It's called a ketchup bottle, and I just think that's a sign.
1661.84 1663.84 LAUREN: It's called a ketchup bottle.

1669.84 1672.84 HOST: The journey has beaten Fran.

1673.84 1678.84 FRAN: This beach is extra cold because it's kind of like open.
1678.84 1682.84 FRAN: I don't feel like I can do anything in this weather because I can't move.

NOTE: ABBY GIVES HER JACKET FOR A COLD FRAN (+1)
1682.84 1684.84 ABBY:  It's a little bit damp.
1684.84 1686.84 ABBY:  Oh, I think he's feeling it, he'll be.
1686.84 1688.84 FRAN: Oh, I love you.
1688.84 1693.84 ABBY: Coming through the jungle again today in pouring rain has tipped her over the edge.
1693.84 1696.84 ABBY:  She's been proper poorly. She's cold all the time.
1696.84 1701.84 ABBY:  And so when we're cold, it's for her, it's like bloody hypothermia.

1701.84 1706.84 HOST: When you're wet, you're malnourished, your body temperature just is going to drop.
1706.84 1712.84 HOST: And it only takes a two degree drop to take you right bang into that danger zone for hypothermia.

1712.84 1716.84 HOST: So the women have an uphill struggle getting Fran warm.

1717.84 1719.84 CHAVALI: I am on firewood GT.
1719.84 1723.84 CHAVALI: We need to get dry firewood.
1723.84 1726.84 CHAVALI: Nothing is dry.
1726.84 1729.84 GEORGINA: There's just no dry standing wood.
1729.84 1734.84  GEORGINA: It's not a little bit wet, honestly. The place is just sort of in the middle of the store.

1734.84 1738.84 FRAN: I don't feel that I could cope with another rain store.
1738.84 1741.84 FRAN: I don't think I'm medically fit for this.

1741.84 1748.84 BELINDA: It really is torture for Fran. She clearly is not a well person.
1748.84 1757.84 BELINDA:  I don't even have any sort of rescue meds, so if she were to collapse, it would take a while to get any further medical help to us.

1763.84 1766.84 HOST: Fran now feels she has no option.
NOTE: FRAN AND JAMIE HUG, BELINDA: AND BETH AND LAUREN AND ABBY ARE THERE DURING HER DEPARTURE, ABBY IS GUTTED 
FRAN LEAVES

1771.84 1773.84 JAMIE: Yes, we have.
1776.84 1779.84 JAMIE: I hope you feel so much better, honey.
1779.84 1783.84 JAMIE: I think you might have died if you stayed.
1783.84 1786.84 JAMIE: And I'm serious. 
1786.84 1788.84 FRAN: Thank you. Well done as well.
1788.84 1793.84 ABBY I am absolutely gutted. I absolutely love Fran. She's ace.
1793.84 1795.84 ABBY: She's our little baby.
1795.84 1804.84 FRAN: Oh, it's going to be my first challenge ever that I for myself did.
1804.84 1809.84 FRAN: I'm really gutted that I can complete it. It's kind of heartbreaking. I try it so hard.

1809.84 1813.84 GEORGINA: Fran, bye my darling. We love you. We love you.
1813.84 1820.84 GEORGINA: Another one down. Now we need to go and anchor the others to trees and make sure none of these are thinking of leaving.



1821.84 1824.84 LAUREN: To lose another team member is so demoralising.
1824.84 1833.84 LAUREN: You can just feel the atmosphere in camp at the minute is just on tender hooks and everyone's thinking, I don't know how long I can keep going like this.

1838.84 1841.84 SPEAKER_14  Look at this shit. I know. What the hell's gone on?
1841.84 1846.84 HOST: The storm and an extreme high tide have washed up a potential treasure trove.
1847.84 1849.84 BEKI: Paradise beach no longer.
1849.84 1851.84 GEORGINA: Oh!
1852.84 1855.84 GEORGINA:  Oh, full swim arm. How could hair clip?
1855.84 1856.84 None  Ta-da!
1856.84 1859.84 CHAVALI: Not only is it a can, it's a can with a lid.

1860.84 1866.84 HOST: I think one of the real unsung heroes in the survivors' arsenal is resourcefulness.

NOTE: JAMIE, BETH, BELINDA: SHARE A DRINK OF A SOFT DRINK THAT WASHED UP (+1)
1866.84 1870.84 JAMIE: What size I am, Drew? Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1870.84 1873.84 JAMIE: Follow us, I am, Drew. Oh, my God!
1873.84 1877.84 JAMIE: Yeah, yeah, hold that, hold that. I thought it was I and Drew. Oh, my God!
1878.84 1881.84 JAMIE: Wait, check sail by date. I don't care.



1885.84 1886.84 None  Oh, my God!
1888.84 1892.84 JAMIE: Oh, my God. So powerfully sweet. So sugary, like, syrup.
1893.84 1896.84 JAMIE: And it was just heaven, absolute heaven.
1896.84 1897.84 JAMIE: Ha-ha-ha!
1899.84 1905.84 BELINDA: Literally just a drop of my tongue, and it felt like ecstasy, absolute ecstasy.

1910.84 1917.84 HOST: The women hope the wood is now dry enough to somehow light a fire to purify the water from a nearby pond.

1917.84 1919.84 BELINDA: This has filled up good. Yeah.
1919.84 1920.84 JAMIE: Thank God for that.
1920.84 1921.84 JAMIE: Thank God.
1922.84 1925.84 JAMIE: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1927.84 1931.84 JAMIE: It is the other fire, Sarah! Whoo!

1931.84 1935.84 GEORGIE:  Hold on, we haven't had a fire yet. This is, like, so early.
1939.84 1941.84 GEORGIE:  Please don't go out, please don't go out.

NOTE: GEORGIE IS ALMOST SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING A FIRE STARTED (+1)
BELINDA, AND LAUREN IS ALSO HELPING WITH THE FIRE, BUT ITS TOO 
WET

1943.84 1945.84 JAMIE: Too fucking wet.
1946.84 1948.84 JAMIE: Shit, what have I got to do?
1948.84 1950.84 JAMIE: Good work, Georgie.
1951.84 1953.84 GEORGIE: Nothing happens without fire.
1953.84 1955.84 GEORGIE:  It's...it's...it's...
1956.84 1959.84 GEORGIE:  It's an inverted triangle. Fire.
1959.84 1961.84 GEORGIE:  Everything comes up with a fire, that's it.
1961.84 1963.84 GEORGIE:  Without fire, we are dead.

1967.84 1978.84 GEORGIE:  I don't have any survival skills, but I'm absolutely happy to step up to the plate if a crocodile needs killing or a snake needs its head chopping off.
1978.84 1982.84 GEORGIE:  And I think the key to our survival on the island is teamwork.
1982.84 1986.84 GEORGIE:  I was actually caught in the tsunami in Sri Lanka.
1986.84 1992.84 GEORGIE:  We didn't eat or sleep for four days, so I have an understanding of what that mental pressure is.
1996.84 1998.84 GEORGIE:  Am I just not putting enough pressure on it?
1998.84 2000.84 GEORGIE:  I think I'm not putting enough pressure on it.

2000.84 2003.84 HOST: Hard as she tries, Georgie can't get it to light.
2003.84 2005.84 HOST: Even now, the wood is dryer.
2005.84 2007.84 UNKNOWN: What's up, Georgie?

2007.84 2009.84 JULIE: It's off past two now.
2010.84 2012.84 JULIE:  No sign of a fire.
2018.84 2020.84 JAMIE: He's had any spindle left, is there?
2020.84 2022.84 JAMIE: I know, it's the thing.
2022.84 2024.84 GEORGIE: That's probably why it's flicking off.
2029.84 2032.84 GEORGINA: Nice and slow. That's it. Keep it like that.

2032.84 2035.84 HOST: The battle for an ember continues through the night.

2037.84 2039.84 SPEAKER_03  We're all getting a little bit panicked.
2039.84 2041.84 BETH: We're starving and thirsty.
2041.84 2043.84 BETH: Surely I'm going to die soon.
2043.84 2045.84 BETH: It's a fucking stupid place.

2045.84 2052.84 HOST: The women have now been without water for more than 48 hours, and they are dangerously dehydrated.

2052.84 2056.84 SPEAKER_22  I feel really drained and really faint.
2056.84 2058.84 BETH: I'm dead.
2063.84 2065.84 GEORGIE: OK, to you, Lauren.
2065.84 2067.84 LAUREN:  Me? Yeah, me.
2067.84 2069.84 GEORGIE: Oh, fuck off.
2069.84 2071.84 SPEAKER_22  It wasn't like that time.
2074.84 2076.84 GEORGIE:  I think we've lost this one, haven't we?

2076.84 2082.84 HOST: So this bow drill set, really, all the parts need to be in perfect proportion for this to work.
2082.84 2088.84 HOST: The problem is the women's drill is now too small because it's been so used.
2088.84 2093.84 HOST: They need to start again. Their situation is now beyond critical.


2096.84 2098.84 LAUREN: It feels so dizzy.
2098.84 2103.84 LAUREN: It's fucking hard work when you've not drunk anything in the heat.
2105.84 2107.84 CHAVALI: I'm really struggling.
2108.84 2110.84 CHAVALI: It feels like I've heard this on this island.
2110.84 2113.84 CHAVALI: It's just to be dehydrated.
2117.84 2119.84 CHAVALI: I'm so thirsty.
2122.84 2125.84 BELINDA: I've got shots of Bravo One over.
2125.84 2128.84 BELINDA: I just wanted to let you know we need some supplies from you.

2128.84 2137.84 HOST: Medical advice is that the castaways are now so critically dehydrated that within a few hours their lives would genuinely be in danger.
2137.84 2141.84 HOST: So really, I've got no choice but to intervene.
2141.84 2145.84 HOST: And the women will be given a working bow drill set.

NOTE: THEY WERE GIVEN A WORKING BOWDRILL SET TO START A FIRE BY THE CREW DUE TO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF DEHYDRATION

2147.84 2151.84 SPEAKER_21  Right, fire startings, sitters, let's do this.
2156.84 2159.84 SPEAKER_14  Purring, ladies, it's purring, actually.
2167.84 2169.84 JULIE: Oh, yes.
2171.84 2173.84 SPEAKER_15  Guys, whoa!
2176.84 2178.84 SPEAKER_15  That's my boy!
2179.84 2181.84 SPEAKER_15  This is great.
2181.84 2183.84 SPEAKER_15  Bravo, Jay!

NOTE: FIRE IS STARTED, GROUP IS HAPPY, GOERGINA PLAYED A BIG ROLE IN GETTING IT STARTED (+1)

2184.84 2188.84 GEORGINA: Now we can start thinking about the bigger things, like our bellies, for example.
2188.84 2194.84 GEORGINA: There's a little something down there which is sitting a bit dangerous to the fire to me (a pig).
2195.84 2197.84 CHAVALI: This is amazing.

NOTE: chavali and abby are bonding (+1) and joking around 
2197.84 2200.84 ABBY: It's cool and clear.
2200.84 2206.84 CHAVALI: And that view, I feel like we're in a luxury hotel and then shortly our butler will come.
2206.84 2208.84 ABBY: What have you ordered for butler service?
2208.84 2209.84 CHAVALI: Ooh, oysters.
2209.84 2211.84 ABBY: Oh, no, not oysters. We can get them here.
2211.84 2212.84 CHAVALI: Oh, yeah.
2212.84 2213.84 ABBY:  Oh, please.
2213.84 2216.84 ABBY:  Order something you can't get here. What would be your first?
2216.84 2220.84 CHAVALI: Double cheeseburger. Absolutely wop it with everything on it.
2220.84 2222.84 CHAVALI: I want to find out what you...
2223.84 2226.84 CHAVALI: Now, what have you ordered from our butler?
2226.84 2228.84 ABBY: SPEAKER_14  From our room service.
2228.84 2230.84 ABBY: I've started with some...
2230.84 2232.84 ABBY: Well, sorry, it is seafood, actually.
2232.84 2233.84 CHAVALI: No, really!
2233.84 2235.84 ABBY: Some deep fried calamari.
2235.84 2243.84 ABBY:  And then, for some weird reason, it's a bit like being pregnant, I want jelly and custard and ice cream.
2243.84 2245.84 ABBY: And I don't even like ice cream.
2245.84 2249.84 ABBY: But I would like jelly, custard and ice cream.
2249.84 2251.84 ABBY: And then a kid's buffet.
2251.84 2255.84 CHAVALI: Oh, kid's buffet! I'm with you with that until I vomit.

2263.84 2265.84 HOST: Day 12 on the island.
2265.84 2272.84 HOST: The women now have fire and plenty of drinking water, but they're barely surviving on just 50 calories a day.

2272.84 2274.84 JULIE: It took me...
2274.84 2279.84 JULIE: I don't know how many hours to get that many almonds.
2279.84 2282.84 SPEAKER_14  It's going to be one almond, if we're lucky.

2282.84 2287.84 HOST: After almost two weeks without a meal, the group is at the point of starvation.
2287.84 2293.84 HOST: If they don't eat soon, there's a genuine risk their organs will start to shut down.

2293.84 2295.84 BETH: I'm fucking hungry.
2296.84 2298.84 BETH:  My tummy has gone away.
2298.84 2301.84 BETH:  I literally have no tummy, look.
2301.84 2305.84 BETH: Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt.
2305.84 2308.84 CHAVALI: My stomach's going, I'm going to have to eat myself.
2309.84 2312.84 CHAVALI: Is that not the cutest thing you've ever seen?
2312.84 2314.84 CHAVALI: Hi, sage and onion.

2316.84 2319.84 HOST: The fate of sage and onion hangs in the balance.
2319.84 2324.84 HOST: The women have befriended them and now can't agree whether or not to eat them.

2324.84 2328.84 BETH: I keep looking at these gorgeous pigs as bits of food.
2328.84 2331.84 BETH: They're too cute, so we can't. I can't.
2331.84 2333.84 BEKI: Now, imagine this.
2333.84 2335.84 BEKI: Barbecue sauce over the ribs, right?
2335.84 2337.84 BEKI: Barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce, right?
2337.84 2340.84 BEKI: Even the tail. Really good, really chewy. I just eat it.
2340.84 2342.84 JULIE: I think we should spit roast in.
2342.84 2345.84 JULIE:  We've got steak up through its bone.
2345.84 2348.84 JULIE:  Not through its mouth. I've through its outer thighs.
2349.84 2356.84 JAMIE: Obviously, I've got a completely different point of view to the rest of the girls because I don't eat meat, but...
2356.84 2360.84 JAMIE: Sage and onion, they're little piglets, and definitely not eating none.
2361.84 2363.84 JAMIE: We've got two pigs, sage and onion,

2363.84 2371.84 GEORGINA: which have become our pet pigs. They followed us all the way from Coconut Beach here, which is a long walk for little legs.
2371.84 2373.84 SPEAKER_14  They were thriving at the other beach.
2373.84 2376.84 ABBY: What's lacking here that they could get at the other beach?
2376.84 2379.84 BELINDA: They were digging up lots of roots at the other beach.
2379.84 2383.84 BELINDA: It was really muddy, so the water collected in the mud.
2383.84 2386.84 BELINDA: Whereas in the sand, water doesn't really collect.
2387.84 2394.84 LAUREN: We have to set a limit to how much we do that compromises our resources over the pig.

2394.84 2400.84 GEORGINA: Over the past few days, people have been laid down with double vision, retching and not being able to walk. Yeah.
2400.84 2403.84 GEORGINA: People are really suffering.
2403.84 2405.84 GEORGINA: We need to eat to survive.
2405.84 2408.84 GEORGINA: Nobody wants to kill anything, but we need to eat.

2408.84 2412.84 HOST: Understandably, a lot of people find the whole concept of killing animals.
2412.84 2423.84 HOST: It's either cruel, it's upsetting, and, yes, it's never pleasant to take a life, but in a survival situation, when it comes down to the wire, it's a simple choice, them or you.

2423.84 2426.84 ABBY:  You're really upset. Everybody's really upset.
2426.84 2429.84 ABBY: Can we get a  show of hands that we agree that we do something soon?



NOTE: girls are debating about the pigs
	All in favor: beth, abby, chavli, lauren, belinda, fi, beki, georgina, georgie, julie
	Not: jamie

NOTE: jamie is very unhappy with the decision, julie tries to comfort her

NOTE: lauren chooses to do the kill, and all in favour are impressed



2433.84 2436.84 ABBY: So, Jamie, where's your mind thinking at the moment?
2436.84 2438.84 ABBY: I don't want anything to do with this.
2442.84 2444.84 SPEAKER_14  Well, who's going to kill her?
2444.84 2446.84 SPEAKER_14  Well, that's the next question.
2447.84 2451.84 LAUREN: I have volunteered myself to do it.
2452.84 2455.84 LAUREN: Just because I know that I'll do it fast.
2455.84 2458.84 JULIE: We're going to get her onto the air, please.
2460.84 2462.84 JULIE: Have a little drink.
2462.84 2464.84 JULIE: I'm going to cry now more than you're taking it.
2464.84 2466.84 JAMIE: I'm sorry.
2466.84 2468.84 JULIE: See, you had been dropped.
2468.84 2470.84 JULIE: It all got attached to them, wasn't it?
2470.84 2473.84 ABBY: I always say, once you've named something your screwed
2473.84 2475.84 JAMIE: Yeah.
2476.84 2482.84 JAMIE: The reason I'm so upset is because it reminded me of my dog.
2484.84 2486.84 JAMIE: And...
2488.84 2493.84 JAMIE: I really thought we were going to have some until we left the island.
2495.84 2498.84 CHAVALI: It makes everything real. It makes everything...
2499.84 2501.84 CHAVALI: Like, whoa.
2501.84 2503.84 CHAVALI:  Pretty raw, isn't it? Yes!
2504.84 2506.84 CHAVALI: It's raw.
2506.84 2511.84 LAUREN: I definitely can make it the most, like, peaceful...
2511.84 2513.84 LAUREN: ...death.
2513.84 2518.84 LAUREN: You know, like, if I was panicking, then it would feel that.
2521.84 2523.84 LAUREN: Anyone sees a good whacker?

2524.84 2526.84 JAMIE: Not annoyed at anybody.
2526.84 2528.84 JAMIE: I just don't want to have any part of it.
2528.84 2531.84 JAMIE: As long as I don't see it or hear it, it just stops it.

2531.84 2534.84 LAUREN: Just gently holding out, because I don't want to struggle.
2534.84 2536.84 LAUREN: I'm coming to be relaxed.

2536.84 2538.84 JULIE: But I'll tell you what.
2538.84 2542.84 JULIE: They've had a little better life than most pigs in captivity that have led to the pork.
2542.84 2546.84 JULIE: Pork wheeze and the chops I buy and the sausages I buy.
2546.84 2548.84 JULIE: They've had no life at all.
2548.84 2551.84 ABBY: I don't know another pig that's gone to bed with a load of people.

Note: BELINDA AND LAUREN, FI ARE TRUSTED TO KILL THE PIG 
	FI CONSOLES LAUREN FOR KILLING THE PIG

2551.84 2554.84 BELINDA: Ready? Should I brace? Absolutely.
2554.84 2556.84 BELINDA: Yeah. 1,2,3...
2557.84 2560.84 PIG: Agh! Agh! Agh!
2566.84 2569.84 FI Well, Laura, absolutely amazingly well done.
2574.84 2577.84 FI:  You did the job really, really well. Really well.
2577.84 2579.84 FI: It was quick. Quick.
2579.84 2581.84 FI: And it was painless.
2581.84 2583.84 GEORGIE:  That was pretty emotional, wasn't it?
2583.84 2585.84 BELINDA: It was pretty horrible.

2585.84 2594.84HOST: It's never easy to take a life, but having learned from this first kill, they actually dispatched the second animal swiftly, cleanly, no hesitation.

2597.84 2603.84 LAUREN: Yeah, I'm glad it wasn't distressed. I'm sure you get it back and get it on the barbecue.

Note: BELINDA AND LAUREN HUG IT OUT (+1)

2606.84 2619.84 LAUREN: I've never, ever killed an animal before, especially as a girl as well, is that I don't think we're designed to want to kill anything, and that's what has been a huge learning curve for me.
2619.84 2621.84 LAUREN: You know, it's reality.
2621.84 2628.84 LAUREN: That's what it is. It's brutal reality that if you want to eat, then you are going to have to kill something.
Note: GEORGINA RESPECTS LAUREN FOR DOING THE KILL, AND IT TAKES COURAGE
2628.84 2632.84 GEORGINA: Gosh, Laura, she's the first of all and safe for the pig.
2632.84 2635.84 GEORGINA: She's very matter-of-fact, very hardworking.
2636.84 2641.84 GEORGINA: Actually, if I could channel a little bit of Laura, I'd be very happy, because she's very impressive.

2642.84 2655.84 LAUREN: We needed something that was going to kick-start us into not viewing animals as pets, but rather as a way that is going to allow us to survive.
2655.84 2662.84 LAUREN: It's going to give us the energy that we need to get hunting, get finding water, to find wood, because that is all exhausting work.

2663.84 2667.84 JULIE: It's very sad, though, if I'm perfectly, perfectly honest.
2667.84 2670.84 JULIE: I'm really looking forward to the meat,
2670.84 2679.84 JULIE: because I think we're all in dire need of a bit of a meal. Harvey, just to let you know, the pig's on the fire.
2679.84 2682.84 CHAVALI: Im not being a hypocrite for a bit. I'll look later. I'm just not ready.
2682.84 2684.84 CHAVALI: Thank you.
2686.84 2689.84 CHAVALI: It's not wee, I'm going to end there until it's all done with.
2689.84 2691.84 JAMIE: I wouldn't mind if I could do that.
2691.84 2694.84 JAMIE: I wouldn't go in there. I'm not eating a pig.

2695.84 2699.84 HOST: This is a really decisive moment of the women's struggle for survival.
2699.84 2703.84 HOST: Now they have the mindset to progress as hunters and killers.
2703.84 2711.84 HOST: They've actually crossed a very important psychological line, and for the first time, they're behaving like survivors.

Note: THE FOOD TASTES GOOD, FI THINKS IT DELICIOUS, EVERYONE IS MOSTLY HAPPY, EXCEPT JAMIE

2713.84 2716.84 CHAVALI: Are you ready, guys? Yeah.
2717.84 2719.84 LAUREN: It tastes good.
2720.84 2723.84 CHAVALI: Oh, my God. It's unbelievably delicious.
2725.84 2728.84 CHAVALI: I don't like the fact that meat's in the piggy, but it is good.

2730.84 2734.84 JULIE: I don't know about anyone else, but I feel like a wild animal.
2734.84 2737.84 JULIE: Like, suck, like a cave woman.

2738.84 2741.84 BETH: Do you think that tube is? It's testicle.
2741.84 2743.84 BETH: I don't know. I quite like things like that.
2743.84 2745.84 BETH: Do you know what I mean? It's quite a savage.
2746.84 2749.84 JULIE: We needed that. I'm not going to lie.
2749.84 2751.84 JULIE:  It was gorgeous.
2752.84 2755.84 JULIE:  I could have had it all myself.
2756.84 2760.84 JULIE: It's all good. I've taken over and out.
