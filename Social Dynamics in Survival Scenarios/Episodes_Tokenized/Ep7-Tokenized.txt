0.00 34.88HOST:  Two uninhabited Pacific Islands. More than 5,000 miles from the UK. One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British women. For six weeks they will be utterly alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools. Filming everything themselves. When pushed to the limits of human endurance.
36.60 43.60HOST:   Will it be brute power? Ooh, that's not a bit of graftus for you boys. Or mental strength
43.72 50.72  VIC:   that wins the day. What size I'm blue? Oh my god. Oh my god. Who will have what it takes
51.72 58.72HOST:   to stay alive? Tonight we follow the men's island. You alright? I think the current's
60.92 67.92  VIC:   got them. Stop bubbling now! Fable cuddle! Like actually could have died.  
68.96 75.96HOST:  Survival willbe harder than ever.  They'll have to endure the height of a harsh tropical storm season.

75.96 79.96 SPEAKER_02  Everyone's wet, everyone's cold, everyone's miserable, everyone's tired. 

79.96 86.96HOST: They'll have  to find their own water and hunt for their own food. What the f***ing hell is that? Have these modern day men got what it takes to survive?

87.60 97.36  VIC:  Your three and a half hour making joke could be done in 25 minutes. You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people is physically easy and you'll stab you in the f***ing eye.

97.36 104.36 SAM:  
106.96 113.96 HOST:   Three weeks ago, 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific island. 

117.96 124.96  VIC:  That was  the dumbest thing I ever did. Living on the edge of existence. Okay, go now, go now. That's it. 
125.40 132.40 HOST:   Until 47 year old Vic. Here we go puppy dog. Led them to capture and kill the island's number one predator. 
133.40 140.40  VIC:  We've just caught a prehistoric animal. 
142.16 149.16 HOST:   But despite their best efforts, they've not been able to repeat the success. Drop empty. The onset of starvation looks upon us.  And the feast has turned to famine. 
149.72 154.60 SAM:  Hey look, you can see Piers' heart beating through his chest.
154.60 163.68  VIC:  Boys, there's no meat on you. I think we're going to run into some really hard times in the next couple of weeks and we'll see. We'll test everybody's mettle. Mine as much as anybody

INTRO ENDS

NOTE: BARNEY SHARES A JOKE WITH ROSS

163.68 177.68 BARNEY:  Guys are snake here. Keep track of it, we're coming. Go bunny. Hook it up. Oh my gosh. Why don't you become a killer? It's food. 
188.44 195.44 BARNEY:  But I see they take no pleasure from doing that whatsoever. It's the second bloody animal I've ever had since being here.
Ross: Killer. (joke)
195.60 199.96HOST:  In the four days since the men co-ordinate the crocodile, they've had to survive on slim  pickings.
199.96 206.96 SAM: Oh hello. It's eaten. It's a little bird or something. A baby bird. 

210.68 217.68 DAN: A bird and a snake. Get him on the fire too. Yeah man. He's been there. PHIL: It's like snake crisps.

218.04 225.04 SAM:  It's very like pork scratching. Oh man, guilt. Oh man, guilt. Oh man, guilt. Oh man, guilt.

226.00 238.20HOST:  Apart from the odd opportunistic kill, the only man who's been able to provide anything like a regular supply of food for the group is 47 year old Vic. 

239.20 249.68  VIC:  Whoo! Whoo! Look at the size of that bitch. Whoo! If I didn't have the mouse to feed I would live like a king. There's no two ways about that. It's a shame nobody else is raking food in because that would be helpful.

249.68 254.92  ROSS: If he wants to go out and catch amazing fish and keeps me fed night, I'm not going to stop the game. 

254.92 329.98HOST:  But even with Vic's contributions, the men are burning far more calories than they're consuming.

PIERS:  I'm slowly evaporating. Soon to dissappear down the pluck hole. 

HOST: What happens in these periods of starvation is that the bodies start to eat into its own fat reserves and key muscle groups like your legs that you desperately need in a survival situation. And then over time as the brain also gets starved of nutrients, that decline becomes mental as well as physical. And that then affects your ability to make smart rational decisions. 

VIC: Yeah, that's new, that's fresh. This is dry as a bone, this stuff. We got it. 
Dan: We got it. Every day the men face a round of essential back-breaking chores. 
Feel pretty tired. We should leave them little time or energy for hunting. 

HOST: With no food to sustain them, the group's cook, Sam Brown, is doing his best to rustle up an edible lunch for leftover fish bits, crocodile bones and limpets. 

NOTE: SAM DOES NOT TRUST ANYONE TO MAKE THE FOOD AND THE LIMPET GUTS WERE ROTTING THE THE BOWLS UNCLEANED. 

329.98 341.14 SAM: We'll put the stew on, we're boiling the bones down, we're going to save the big bones so we can make a stock and try to feed 11 people in the next hour or two hours. A lot of the cooking has fallen on my shoulders.
341.42 352.38 SAM: I'd rather do it and do it well than watch someone else f*** it up and go hungry or I have to pick fish scales out of my food. 
SAM: Oh f*** sake guys. F*** filled with limpet guts.
352.38 374.86 SAM: We've got 11 bowls, three of which have been used as spittoons. That's overnight rotting limpet guts. That's disgusting and that's going to give us diarrhea, vomiting, that's going to get you off the island really fast. Somebody needs to be on washing up detail.
374.86 384.74 PHIL: Wanna wash all of them? 
SAM: Yeah. Don't wash themselves boys. 

VIC: I think what you just said, they're unfair there. 
SAM: I'll talk to them when we get back. 
VIC: don't know why didn't you do it?
384.74 393.22 SAM:  Do what? Why don't you take them down and wash them? Because I'm washing the fire and I'm cooking the soup. 
VIC: That's not a massive hard task though is it? 
SAM: Well if that soup pot falls over it, we're all stabbed. 
393.22 401.02  VIC: We're all f***ed. It's not a physically hard task though is it?
SAM: It's not a physically hard task. 
VIC: Farmers are really working really hard. We're all sweating those bowls off. We are.
401.02 408.02 SAM:  Okay mate, cook a pot of soup and we'll talk. 
408.02 418.50  VIC: All right. 

VIC: There are one or two people that are fantastic at avoiding what they're meant to do and lucky busy doing very little. 

418.50 429.34 SAM:I kind of think like if a tree falls in the  forest and Vic's not there to hear it, it doesn't count. Like only work that he does or work that people do right next to him counts. F*** that s***. 

NOTE: VIC AND SAM ARE NOT HAPPY WITH EACH OTHER

429.34 451.24HOST: The men on the island, they're spending every waking hour in each other's company and they get no respite from the intensity of that situation and in many ways it's little surprise that they're starting to turn on each other. 

SAM: Okay, this should be good. 

451.24 464.92 HOST: After a morning of hard labour, the hungry men sit down hoping to enjoy Sam's soup. 

CHARLIE: God it smells funky isn't it? 
VIC: Smells like crap. 
CHARLIE: There is some distinct smell of poo about this. 
PHIL: It's a bit like dog s*** doesn't it? 

464.92 477.24 PHIL: Yeah. I just  couldn't swallow it. I literally couldn't swallow it. Almost made me puke. 

477.24 484.20HOST:  After a barely edible lunch, Vic is determined to have a decent dinner. 

484.20 491.72  VIC: I might fish. What choice do I have? I don't want to eat limpets again. Their crap. I'll eat them but theyâ€™re crap. 

491.72 497.28HOST: Flagging  after their morning chores, the rest of the men decide to stay behind in camp. 

497.28 534.04  PIERS: Everything is an effort. That's how I feel right now. 

FARMAR: Absolutely knackered. Completely an absolutely knackered

VIC: Nobody asks me to go fishing but they know I'll go fishing to get food and I know they're doing the daily chores but guys will start going that extra yard. Come on boys. Once you've finished your duties or you don't have much of a duty, that ain't end of day is it?

534.04 551.72  VIC:  I am prejudiced against everybody that isn't me because if you all did it my way it would be a much better place. I provide for my family. I'm a good father. I'm a good husband.
551.72 561.72  VIC:  I hope I'm an excellent lover. I don't know how I'm going to cope without speaking to my wife and kids for that length of time. I've no idea. I really don't know. No idea. 
561.72 569.96  VIC: It's gives me goosebumps Not sure. 

CHARLIE: Dude you are an absolute fish tickling bastard aren't you? TO vic:

570.52 576.76HOST:   Late afternoon, After four hours of fishing Vic has single handedly provided dinner for the rest of the men. 

576.76 603.96  VIC:  That is so hard. I'm fucked. Have we even  got any coconut now?
CHARLIE: No.
VIC: It's getting harder and harder every day coming back and seeing everybody laid on fucking beach and im catching fish. No I'm alright. I need a sit down. I need coconut. I need water. 
SAM: Coconuts  we're getting tomorrow. 
VIC: Fucking hell. Thought we were going out for coconut or something.
603.96 607.56  VIC:  How difficult would it be for two or three lads to go across and get a bag full of coconuts?
607.56 616.36 VIC:   What do you want me to do with that as well? 

HOST: Fed up with a group taking in for granted  Vic's made a big decision.

616.36 628.48  VIC:  Bollocks do it. I'm not fishing anymore. Somebody else go fishing. I might have a couple of days off. See how everybody fares then. Somebody else
turn to step up to the plate. 

628.48 639.68 BARNEY: Wowzers. You've done incredibly well Vic. You really have been. You've done absolutely brilliantly. You're absolutely nailed it. Thanks so much.
640.96 649.84  VIC:  I have a couple of things to say and I'm unsure whether to say them now because I don't want to spoil the atmosphere or save them till the end of the night. So do I say them now? Say them now? To ALL:
650.80 661.76  VIC:  Okay today I spent fishing all day on my own but we're all sat around here happiest pigs and shit eating though now and I went without a buddy. 
WILL: perhaps you shouldn't have gone without a buddy.
662.32 674.08  VIC:  But if I hadn't gone when I went we wouldn't all be eating. I certainly don't want to be busting a gut and come back to see people. Kipping, pampering, tossing it off, doing whatever.
674.08 678.16  VIC:  It's not fair. It's not fair. That's top and bottom of it. It's not fair.
679.28 688.24  VIC:  I think it's a very good point Vic and I'm glad you raised it. So I'll put my rods down, you'll fish for your own snap and I'll eat limpets like rest of yours.

690.00 693.20HOST:   The group's most skilled hunter has gone on fishing strike.

694.72 703.VIC: That's it. Okay. Understood. 
HOST: The burden of finding food will now fall on the rest of the men.

705.04 707.04 DAN: We are knackered.
708.80 710.80 DAN: We're screwed.

710.80 716.08 ROSS: We have our lives solely on fish, rod catching, most of them from Vic.
716.08 720.40 ROSS: But tomorrow I'm a bit worried because I'm not sure the guys are going to cope.
722.08 724.08 ROSS: It scares me.

724.08 736.08 DAN: I think everyone's feeling a little bit sluggish today, aren't they? 
SAM: Yeah, I know what you mean.

736.80 741.04HOST:   7am. Dan and Sam Brown are on the early morning water run.

742.80 747.92 DAN How are you feeling after your little debate yesterday? 
SAM: Oh, Vic? Yeah. Pretty good.
747.92 756.40 DAN: I think Vic was just maybe trying to pick a bit of a fight yesterday. 
SAM: Yeah, he likes to push buttons.
757.52 770.40 SAM:  I think he likes to niggle. He likes a little... 
DAN: Yeah. 
SAM: He sort of, he likes, he has a sort of like, uh, oh, I'm nice as pie, I don't know, fuck off he is. 
VIC: Where's my hat? 

770.40 775.36HOST:   Last night, 47-year-old Vic, the group's most successful hunter, announced that he was going on fishing strike.


776.32 784.16  VIC:  I'm absolutely knackered. Are you? Yeah, yeah, I am, yeah. This trudging out, catching fish and trudging back day after day after day after day after day after day. It's not fair.
786.88 789.52 WILL: How many fishing lanes have you hooked up before, Phil? 
PHIL: None.

790.96 796.88HOST:   The burden of finding a fish supper now lies with the other men. 

796.88 801.36 FARMAR: There is absolutely no food in this camp. There is no reserve. There's no larder that we have here at the moment. So if we don't catch anything today, we don't eat.

801.44 808.64 WILL Right, so where are the points to go fishing? 
808.64 815.28 HOST:   Although refusing to fish himself, Vic doesn't want to go hungry, so he offers the men some advice. 
815.28 822.80  VIC: Get your hook and put it through the limb pit at the top, okay, then turn the limb pit and come back through the soft gel. Feel, feel, feel, boom.
822.80 832.24 FARMAR: But if you've hidden on it, I would say just hidden and right on the edge. Yeah. Because they nibble on the edge and they want them to just get, nibble it and get caught.
832.24 836.96  VIC:  You undermine me every time, when I start telling about stuff and it's rude. Oh, please don't do it.
836.96 844.64  FARMAR:  Sorry. Okay. I thought I was adding. 
VIC: No. So if you put two limb pits on, 

FARMAR: he was very quick to swipe at me.
844.64 856.96 FARMAR: And I think maybe Vic has lost perspective a little bit. He thinks that he's the kingpin and that he is providing more than anyone else and doing more than everyone else. 
856.96 863.68  VIC: I don't know if he feels he needs to contribute. So if we all think he's contributed or I don't know, but it's rude. He shouldn't do it.

874.08 880.80 WILL: I'm thinking three, maybe four bottles around each pole and then just like that all the way along.
880.80 882.48 CHARLIE: We are going to adapt and overcome.
884.48 889.92HOST:   36 year old Will has come up with an ambitious plan to fish the deeper waters surrounding the island.

889.92 904.96 WILL: We've got to make a raft so we can get in the middle of the channel. Massive hook, big fish bait. I would love it to have a tuna. That would be the best day ever. Imagine that. Sashimi.
904.96 926.00 WILL: I don't have any oil drums or anything. What we've got on this island is shed loads of empty plastic bottles. Fingers crossed she'll float. 

VIC: Right. Let's get trucking. 
926.00 939.52HOST: While he waits for the men to find him food, Vic takes the opportunity to make a bed for himself. So unlike the others, he'll be protected from critters on the jungle floor. 
939.52 954.00  VIC:Look at that natural twine. What an absolute  biscuit. Yeah, I'm happy with this so far. I don't have a double bed, I'm afraid, so I can't interest my wife in sleeping with me this evening. So I'm just going to single it up. 
954.00 961.20HOST:   Having isolated himself from the other men, Vic's thoughts are increasingly turning to family. 

961.28 972.40  VIC:  Had a very unnerving dream last night about home, which was very horrible, woke me up in not such a pleasant mode. I'm missing home desperately. I keep thinking more and more about my wife and kids every day.
974.64 979.68  VIC:  I could do with a kiss and a cuddle of my missus, squeeze the life out of the blesser.

991.20 1005.92HOST:   Will's raft is ready to set sail. 
1007.52 1014.64 WILL:   I came up with the idea. I shall name this raft after my two gorgeous daughters, Freya and Pippa. So we call it Frippster. 
ROSS: Nice mate.
1014.64 1022.80 KYLE: You're getting me. 
PIERS: I'll get you guys. Even.
1022.80 1035.52 ROSS: It looks like a bunch of bottles attached to
some planks because it is a bunch of bottles attached to some planks . But our livelihoods and our dependency on food relies on it. So go on, Frippster.
LAUNCHING THE RAFT, CHARLIE, PIERS, WILL, DAN, KYLE with Barney + Ross +Farmar with cameras, PHIL in the back and VIC watching
WILL: Fingers crossed we're in all the launch.
1036.16 1044.32 WILL: Get some fish. I name this boat, Frippster, the first. 
PIERS: Long may she catch us fish from the deep.
1045.12 1048.56 CHARLIE: All right. I'll make it out. 
DAN: Are you ready?
1050.56 1053.12  CHARLIE:  You are sailing the French de Vros.
1055.12 1057.44  DAN:   See you in two weeks, mate. 
KYLE: Bye.
WILL: 1059.44 1089.52:   She floats. She floats!!.

HOST:  I think one of the real unsung heroes in the survivor's arsenal is resourcefulness. Being able to look at an everyday object and think of clever, ingenious ways of using it to help you. The riffs are big, but the spoils could be even bigger if that raft succeeds. 

WILL: Bigger strokes, mate. Reach. To PIERS:

1094.48 1097.28HOST:  After a huge joint effort from all the men, apart from Vic, the raft appears to be a success. Most of the group are now out trying to catch supper.

1098.56 1100.96 SPEAKER: I've got the patience for fishing. I'll tell you that for nothing.

1103.20 1107.60 HOST:  Leaving the grueling job a firewood to Vic, and IT consultant, Kyle.
1108.64 1113.60  VIC:  Kyle, why do we need a shitload more kindling today than we have done? It's not every stuff, is it?
KYLE: Yeah
1115.76 1132.08  VIC:  Kyle's still quite gifted at doing very little, but that's the problem with the intelligent people because they think they're clever than the people that they're out doing the job for. They think they can out think them. When it comes to manual labor, Jesus Christ, stop getting all crazy. It's manual labor, which is every job we've got.
1134.88 1149.20  VIC:  I think on this island there will be people that come off physically bollocks regardless of diet, whether we eat or we don't eat, and the guys come off who aren't. And if we're not all hanging out of our ass, end of this, somebody hasn't been working hard enough, have they? Would you agree with that?
1149.20 1159.36 KYLE: No, it could happen where we're not all spent. We work hard as a team, we achieve a lot, and at the end we're not all hanging out of our asses. That could happen.
1159.36 1175.76  VIC:   What the fuck are you talking about? 
KYLE: I'm talking English. 
VIC: I'm uneducated, you have to lower it down to my level. 
KYLE: What didn't you understand? I don't know where. 
VIC: You're telling me the Yorkshire, layman's terms. Every job is a manual job, do we agree? 
KYLE: Yeah. 
VIC: So if we all plow into that 100% manually, we will all be bollocks at the end of this journey.
1175.76 1185.04 KYLE: I've already said I don't think at the end of this. 
VIC: Right, then let me say it again then. 

KYLE: All he goes on about is this is a physical place, every task in there is physical. ( VIC )
1185.04 1195.28 KYLE: Whoopee doo. You know, that's brilliant, but we're not all just grunts that have been sent out here to bash on bits of wood. 

VIC: You can talk your way around whatever you want, top and bottom of it is,
1195.28 1206.80  VIC:  it's a physical island, every job's physical, we should all be bollocks. If not, somebody's carrying somebody else. That's the top and bottom of it.TO KYLE

1221.84 1227.44 HOST:   Mid-afternoon. Still reeling from yesterday's argument with Vic, Sam Brown is trying to catch some dinner.

1227.44 1234.40 SAM:  Vic keeps making little remarks to me that just make me seethe

1235.28 1242.96 BARNEY: So what was getting his goat this morning? Oh mate, I'll load a thing. If we can catch some fish. Hopefully Vic will be in a slightly better mood.
1245.04 1249.52 HOST:   After three hours on the water, BARNEY: and Sam haven't had a single bite.
1251.60 1268.00 SAM: So what are you thinking with this rod? 
BARNEY: I'm thinking, I don't know, maybe they always say patience is a virtue, don't they? And I'm quite impatient. Is that line tight? 
SAM: No. No bite.
1269.92 1271.04 BARNEY: Oh fuck it, let's go in.

1277.60 1281.12HOST:   With nightfall approaching, the other men also return to camp.
1282.80 1286.40HOST:   Vic is waiting to see how many fish they have caught in his absence.
1286.80 1296.64 VIC: No joy fella. 
PHIL: No, I had a nice day fishing as you'd say Vic. Not catchy. 
VIC: No dog should learn new tricks.
1297.28 1300.56  VIC:  You should listen when I tell him. 
FARMAR: Did he not listen? 
VIC: No.
1304.08 1309.36 CHARLIE: Four hours fishing and one poxy trigger. I fucking hate fishing.
1309.60 1317.12 CHARLIE: It's exhausting just standing there in the sun for X amount of hours.

1321.60 1327.04 VIC: Charlie, caught one fish. Well that ain't feeding nobody is it? That ain't feeding Jack shit.

1328.96 1330.00 SAM: It's just limpets again.
1331.92 1336.64HOST:   The men's attempts to provide dinner without Vic's help have been a miserable failure.

1340.16 1341.68 BARNEY: Desperation corner over here.

1343.44 1354.80  VIC:  Pressure is on me to feed everybody. It's almost as though I am expected to grab a rod and go out and catch fish so everybody else can eat. And that ain't good. I don't like that. 
VIC: See you morning ladies.
1354.80 1363.60HOST:   With no food in camp, Vic opts for an early night in his new bed
. 
VIC: You on the beach sir? Oh dear.
1363.60 1372.56  VIC:  Oh yeah. Let me get myself ready for bed.
1374.56 1379.44  VIC:  Oh dear god yeah that's lovely. That is look. 

KYLE: He has to remember that we are a team here and with certain things he is quite selfish. ABOUT VIC

1379.44 1390.32 VIC: It does not get any better does he? 

KYLE: For a family man I might have expected him to be a more considerate of others. ABOUT VIC

1393.92 1396.24  VIC:  Oh boys you don't know what you're missing.

1404.16 1412.08HOST:   Vic's bed is a success. While on fishing strike 47 year old Vic has built himself a raised bed.

1414.24 1425.28  VIC:  Yeah that was a good night's kip that. Some lovely dreams. For some reason one of his new giants on Ross. When ended up in his house he's trying to catch his fish out of his fish tank.
1426.48 1427.28  VIC:  Cant think why. Oh I love my bed.

1429.68 1437.92 HOST:   Protected from the jungle critters Vic has had his best sleep yet.
1444.24 1446.32 HOST:   While the others have had their worst.
1446.32 1451.84 ROSS::   Oh my legs are bit into shit. My arms are bit into shit.
1453.36 1459.12HOST:   Sleeping rough on the jungle floor the men have been attacked overnight by a swarm of sand flies.
1459.12 1463.68 ROSS: They're everywhere covered in them. They must have you know 500 bites or so.
1464.32 1468.08 KYLE: I'm just not having a good reaction to them and they're starting to swell up.

1469.12 1479.68 HOST:   You may think on a desert island your real enemies are the crocs, the scorpions, the snakes but actually it's often the little things you can't see and worse of these are sand flies.
1479.68 1485.76HOST:   They're super itchy, ten times worse in a mosquito. You scratch away, it's hot, it's humid and that's when the bites can become infected. 

1485.76 1506.96 DAN: They have had a massive gore. Oh this island either wants to decompose you from the outside in or eat you alive.
1514.48 1516.64 DAN: Good job I'm not going on a date anytime soon.

1519.76 1524.64HOST:   Reeling from last night's infestation the men call an emergency meeting.
1524.64 1528.32 ROSS:  I've got to put my hands up and say my incident points are so bad I can barely walk.
1529.44 1543.52 ROSS: I can't even walk, I can't even go in the sun. So I'm happy to chop wood and stuff in here but if I go in the sun my legs just flare up and I can't even move them. Tomorrow it might be down but today is absolutely excruciating. It's like someone's puffing fire into my calves and I'll move them
1543.52 1554.96 SAM: . My worry with these bites because they just seem to be like escalating a notch like that. I worry that what with all the rain some other kind of bug might have hatched they might be starting to feast on us.
1554.96 1560.48 FARMAR: Today priorities I think we just concentrate on just trying to get as many of these beds up as possible.


1561.04 1571.44HOST:   Raised beds are the group's best protection against further attacks. 

VIC: Right you're ready because this one might jump.

1571.44 1580.88HOST:   Having built his own yesterday, Vic temporarily ends his work to rule to lend a helping hand.

1581.44 1587.44  VIC:  I think all of us as a full team of 11 get stuck into beds. Everybody's bed.
1588.48 1592.56  VIC: Go on give it some.  Come on it takes. TO FARMAR
VIC: It might be quite a pushy weight so we really get stuck into it.
1593.52 1601.92  VIC:  Come on it fella. All the eleven stone here. Bingo! That's a lot of bit of graftless for you boys. To Piers

1603.44 1606.56  FARMAR:  Right mine's here. What do you think? 
VIC: Perfect.

1612.32 1623.12HOST:   With all available hands on beds and nobody hunting or fishing, cameraman Sam Brown has once again spent the morning trying to conjure up something for lunch.
1623.12 1628.00 SAM:  I feel a little bit like this child catcher this morning. We're going to boil them all to death and then eat them with soup.
1630.00 1649.28  SAM:  Shush my pretties. It's nearly over. 
VIC: I think the only job I haven't done so far on this tour is the difficult task of cooking. Mmm cooking. 
DAN gives the cameraman a look after VICâ€™s questionable statment
VIC: Right Sam, those guys up there busting the knackers. I don't know how many blisters. I'm going to help the lads with wood. That's all.
1649.28 1652.56  SAM:  I've just been up to help the lads with wood and they've no more for me to carry down.
1652.56 1663.84 VIC: Let's chop some down then. 

SAM: If it keeps going like that you know. I'll react. No I know I will. About VIC:

1663.84 1675.92  VIC: It's good for us to vent. Fucking hell. Shite! It's good to get it off your chest now and again BARNEY You lazy bunch of bone idol bastards. Makes us all feel much better.
1677.84 1687.04 SAM:  They're chopping wood. They're not busting your guts. I can't help them chop more because I don't have a fucking machete. He's only got three of them. 

1687.04 1697.52HOST:  A leadless group fighting to stay alive is always going to face conflict and what happens individuals tend to push their own agendas and that in turn takes away valuable time valuable energy for the things that really matter.

1700.72 1703.92 WILL:  How's the soup looking Sam? 
SAM: Really good mate really really good.
1705.84 1708.80  VIC:  You know a three and a half hour making soup would be done in 25 minutes.
1710.00 1719.04  SAM:  You want it you really? 
VIC: How difficult can stirring soup be? To some would look like you didn't want to go do the harder job. 
WILL: Excuse me? 
VIC: Some would say it's because you didn't want to go bust the gut.
1719.04 1727.20 SAM: I would say fuck you to that person that's what I'd say. 
DAN: No hang on hang on hang on hang on. So we just calm it down a bit. We're here for another what three or four weeks.
1727.92 1731.04 DAN: Just let's fucking calm down there. There's no need to be like this.
1732.56 1735.28 SAM:  So you're saying I'm avoiding graft pick is that what you're saying? Are you?
1736.24 1769.60 SAM:  That sounded very much like you were just a second ago. 
VIC: You're answering a question with a question are you? 
SAM: What 
VIC: are you?
SAM:  What am I avoiding grapt? 
VIC: Yeah. 
SAM:I fucking don't think so man. 
VIC Then why are you biting then? 
SAM: What? Because you've been niggling for weeks. This is what it boils down to for me Vic. You act like certain jobs are like macho jobs, fishing, chopping wood, everything else, women's work. That's the feeling I get right? And if that's cooking, if that's fucking carrying water, whatever it is in your head it's like this is grapt, this is good, everything else not difficult.
1769.60 1780.48  VIC:  I think feeding everybody is one of the most important jobs on this island. So do I. Every job is a manual job. Some jobs are done. 25 minutes they're done. SAM: Yeah?
VIC: And every three quarts of an hour you stir it
1780.48 1789.44 SAM: . Yeah.
VIC: Is that right? 
SAM: What I'm trying to do Vic is get as many good meals out of this as I can right? Rather than just use it once and throw it away. 
VIC: Which is appreciated because we all need it. 
SAM: Yeah.
1794.48 1803.04 SAM:  So maybe just keep your comments to yourself if you don't know about it huh? 
VIC:I thought we were allowed to wear those comments. 
SAM: Yeah well it's great but if you want to fucking like if you want to piss me off you're going about it the right way.
1808.80 1813.36  VIC:  Some jobs are physically easy. Some jobs aren't. Is that a better way for...
1813.36 1817.84 SAM:  You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people is physically easy and he'll stab you in the fucking eye.

SAM AND VIC ARE NOT HAPPY WITH EACH OTHER
WIll: are you absolutely furious 
1831.92 1849.84 SAM:  If a mate said that to me I'd fucking hit them you know. If someone at work said that we'd have trouble. Fucking but I just I don't know. There's no good way to take that right?
1850.56 1856.08 SAM:  I take that as like a stab at my integrity. Fuck it man.
1856.08 1862.48 SAM:  I look forward to sitting down in some 25-minute soup at some stage.

1873.44 1879.36 CHARLIE: We have built the honeymoon suite. It is strong enough for the rumpy pumpy. You understand? Yeah.

1879.36 1890.48HOST:   4pm after a day of hard graft the beds are finished. 

DAN: Welcome to the chateau. Let's open the curtain.
1892.96 1898.96 DAN: And that there is the most uncomfortable beds anyone will ever sleep on.
1898.96 1909.76 PIERS: Ah this is where the magic happens. 
DAN: It's not too bad actually. I want to say one thing.
1909.76 1915.52 PIERS: What? 
DAN: Right above your head. A lot of daylight. 
PIERS: That is my skylight.

1918.64 1927.12HOST:   The men will now have better protection from the jungle critters but the day of hard physical labour has left them hungry and shattered.

1928.08 1934.32 FARMAR: I am running on empty. I feel like I'm lugging my body about. I can't even stand up straight.
1934.96 1937.36 FARMAR:  I'm starting to sway. Starting to slur my words a bit
.
1942.16 1952.88HOST:   Since Vic went on fishing strike the men have survived on Sam's leftover soup and slivers of coconut. And Vic isn't impressed.

1953.84 1956.96  VIC: If I eat any more of this shit I want to puke. It's horrible.
1958.96 1963.60  VIC:  Coconut. Yay! That's your shit through the iron needle.
1964.88 1968.08  VIC:  Mother nature you can be a cruel, cruel mistress. Do you know that?
1971.44 1975.52  VIC:  She's not going to beat me. She's certainly not going to beat me.
1983.76 1987.12 VIC: Fucking hellfire. Disgusting.
1990.88 1992.72  VIC:  That's great. That's it. I've had enough.

1995.84 2010.96 VIC:   Come on Victor let's have some fish. 
HOST: Despite Vic's strike he's determined to catch a decent fish supper and persuades Kyle to join him on the raft. 
2010.96 2013.84  VIC:  Instead of catching little fish. I want to be catching something bigger.
KYLE: What's getting out there? 

2015.52 2025.04 CHARLIE: With my health and safety hat on I'd be more worried that we've got a homemade raft and some very strong currents in a very deep piece of water.

2026.88 2037.52HOST:   Vic and Kyle are already 200 yards for sure. Should something happen they're dangerously out of their depth.

KYLE: Oh this is something Vic. 
2040.08 2041.20  VIC:  Oh. Has daddy got a tug?
2042.88 2050.16  VIC:  Oh! Oh! I think daddy might have a tug. Get on end of that kid.
2052.32 2058.56  VIC:  I'm not sure what it is. What the fuck is that? What the effing hell is that?
2059.36 2065.12  VIC:  We got ourselves a fucking eel kid. You sir are going fucking nowhere. Can you hold that for me?
2065.12 2071.20  KYLE:  Yeah of course. 
VIC: Thank you. Right now I've pinned him.
KYLE:  Pinned him down to the side.
2074.72 2079.36  VIC:  I now need to club him with something. I think that might be this. I've got plenty of space.
2079.84 2086.56  VIC:  Oh yes. Yeah I do believe that's him as we speak now. Don't panic don't panic don't panic.
2086.56 2096.16  VIC:  Oh you fucker. I don't like this fucking fighting bollocks at all. I really don't.
2096.24 2097.20  VIC:  I really don't.

2103.52 2112.24 PIERS: They're 200, 240 yards out now and still going. 

2112.24 2123.68HOST:  One of the most precious resources that the men actually have is their own energy. When you're living hand to mouth struggling for every mouthful of food the temptation is to go to greater and greater lengths to get that precious energy.

2124.24 2142.08 VIC:   That's it. I can now tie you up safely. 

HOST: But here's the danger. The more malnourished the men get the more their judgment gets impaired. That's when the small mistakes become full-blown emergencies and that can happen in the blink of an eye. 

KYLE: So they're just putting us back.
2142.72 2146.48  VIC:  Come on. I tell you that is one hell of a tide isn't it? 
KYLE: They're getting carried.
2148.72 2152.16  VIC:  We are going backwards. All right go on paddle, paddle, paddle. Don't stop.
2152.16 2156.24HOST:   Vik and Kyle are attempting to paddle back to the beach.
2157.36 2160.64  KYLE:  I don't like this man. 
VIC: No neither do I. Start paddling now.
2163.44 2168.80HOST:   But they've been caught by a powerful undercurrent. 
VIC: Paddle, paddle, go.
2172.64 2174.72 DAN:  You all right? I think the currents got them.
2176.96 2177.60 SAM: Come on let's go.
2182.16 2188.24  VIC:   Come on. Come on boy.
2189.92 2202.08 VIC:  Yeah. We're gonna crash though. Come on. 
HOST: At the mercy of the current the raft is on a collision course with the island's treacherous rocky coastline which could tear the men to shreds.
2202.08 2208.72  VIC:  Come on Kyle. Dig the fucker in. Paddle, paddle. A turn again. Oh maybe. It'll...
2209.28 2212.40  VIC:  Right paddle, paddle, paddle. Don't stop. Don't stop.
2216.72 2221.92  VIC:  Everybody safe. Everybody, okay. No injuries. Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord for that.

2223.68 2228.96HOST:   After surviving a near-death experience the men are shaken but physically unscathed.

SAM AND DAN SAVE KYLE AND VIC

2230.72 2235.60  VIC:  They all got mangled up and chashed up. 
HOST: Their raft though is destroyed.
2238.72 2246.16 DAN: It's fucking scary man. 
KYLE: Yeah it is. We're getting smashed in the rocks now so I do appreciate that.

2247.60 2252.56 HOST:   Sam and Dan's swift actions saved Vic and Kyle from annihilation on the rocks.

2253.76 2259.04 SAM:  It's fucking hairy mate. I think that was the closest that being to coffing it at this trip.
2259.60 2262.96  VIC:  Thanks for coming in helping us guys. 
SAM: Let's get back to camp before dark.
2263.68 2266.16 SAM:  First light tomorrow we'll try and salvage as much of this as we can.
2269.04 2275.84 HOST:   With their raft in tatters and Vic's eel lost to the ocean the men now face a second night with empty stomachs.

2285.28 2292.00 PHIL: Where the hell's the rest of the raft? 
PIERS: Oh shit is that the raft? 
DAN: Frippster is no longer boys.

2292.00 2298.00 SAM:  Vic's got a brave face on it but he's really shook up. He could have just been knocked unconscious.
2298.00 2303.36 SAM:  The brain splattered out in a rock. He could have died. Like actually could have died.

2304.88 2308.16 HOST:   Vic's near-death experience isn't the only thing on his mind.
2309.84 2313.68  VIC:  It's been a little bit quite difficult today truth's known for me.
2314.64 2318.64  VIC:  It's come up to the fifth which is the date of my first date with my missus.
2318.72 2321.36  VIC:  And I'm missing her immensely.
2321.36 2328.56  VIC:  So tomorrow I may spend lots and lots of time contemplating my missus and all that sort of thing.

2334.56 2336.56  PHIL:  Morning. To ROSS
2349.52 2351.44 BARNEY: Oh morning. To ROSS
2351.44 2358.80 HOST:   After a savage sandfly attack 24 hours ago, the men have spent their first night raised off the ground in their own beds.

2359.76 2361.76 ROSS: Good morning.
2361.92 2368.32 ROSS: Oh last night was wonderful. Last night was the best unbroken sleep I've had by a mile.

2371.04 2373.68HOST:  This time it is Vic who hasn't slept a wink.
2374.88 2380.16 CHARLIE: Vic looks like he spent the entire night sitting on a fence post. The poor bugger looks absolutely drained today.

2383.12 2385.84 DAN Vic looks a little bit edgy today.
2388.00 2390.00 DAN I can see him cracking a little bit.

2391.44 2400.32 ROSS:  Hopefully he's all right. You know he's one of the kind of guys who has switched emotions. He's definitely that kind of old-school British match or meal.

2401.04 2405.04  HOST:   Today is the 20th anniversary of Vic's first date with his wife.
2406.24 2408.80  VIC:  Never again. Never again this long.
2411.44 2415.04  VIC:  The greatest thing that ever happened to me other than being born was my wife.
2415.60 2420.24  VIC:  I can't wait to get back to Cheryl. Smell her taste, her touch, her feel, all them things.
2421.68 2425.12  VIC:  I love that woman so much. It's immense. Truly immense.
2425.36 2427.36  VIC:  Truly immense.
2428.64 2433.76 HOST:   As human beings when we're stripped of everything the real essence of who we are is laid bare.
2436.16 2442.48HOST:   Every single one of them will have a low point. It is just the nature of survival. It's the nature of enduring hardship.
2443.36 2453.94HOST:   If you can take a long hard look at yourself when you're at your lower step and in that moment you can accept what you see, in my eye, that's what makes your true survivor.

2455.68 2458.24 SAM:  Devastated. Absolutely devastated.
2458.88 2461.52 DAN: This is literally what we were getting smashed against yesterday.
2462.40 2464.40 SAM: So dangerous. Yeah.

2467.12 2469.52  VIC:  I feel so dreadful at the moment. It's unbelievable.
2470.08 2475.76  VIC:  This beautiful, dangerous paradise. It can be a killer. You take your eye off the ball and she's going to bite you in the ass.
2477.44 2480.88  VIC:  The raft crash will stay with me till the day I die.
2481.04 2483.04  VIC:  These guys saved my life.

2488.48 2491.36 HOST:   In camp, Vic calls the men together for a chat. 
VIC SAYS SORRY TO SAM, KYLE, DAN, FARMAR and BARNEY 
2494.80 2502.40  VIC:  I'd just like to say if I've ever offended anybody, upset them, unduly and it weren't deserved and I apologize, it won't happen again.
2502.64 2505.68  VIC:  I worry immensely about providing for me and mine.
2506.08 2511.36  VIC:  So perhaps that's why I compensate for working so physically hard like a fool, like a donkey.
2512.48 2517.04  VIC:  I've got a fantastic wife and kids, but I have this overwhelming urge to provide.
2517.92 2524.08  VIC:  It drives me more than anything else and the fear of not being able to do that is terrifying. Terrifying.
2525.60 2533.84 DAN: Vic, the man that said a few weeks ago, he does not see the point in crying.
2536.48 2538.48 DAN: He cried.
2539.04 2544.24 DAN: The way that you describe your wife and your family, I find inspirational. TO VIC
2546.24 2553.04 DAN: I've never known a man to come away with a group of guys and to say I love my wife to bits.
2554.24 2557.76 DAN: She's the best thing I've ever experienced in my life. I've never heard that.
2558.56 2561.52 DAN: And that's one thing I'm going to take away from you. I'm going to take that.
2561.52 2565.76 SAM:  Every time you talk about Cheryl, I feel like she's in the room.
2565.76 2568.64 SAM:  Don't get me wrong, Vic, you pissed me off more than just about anyone here.
2570.16 2575.04 SAM:  But overall, mate, you're worth every ounce of you. You've lifted us up more times than I can say.
2575.84 2578.64 SAM:  We'd be seriously worse off if you weren't here.
2581.28 2584.32  VIC:  I weren't expecting this. I'll be honest with you, not at all.
2585.28 2590.56  VIC:  I expected difficulties and hungers and confrontation and conflict, but not to find something out about me.
2590.64 2592.64  VIC:  That was the last thing I expected.

2597.28 2599.84  VIC:  What a great bunch of blokes these really are.
2600.40 2603.92  VIC:  What a great bunch of blokes. I ain't never going to see eye to eye with them all.
2604.48 2608.48  VIC:  On this island, it's a family. It's the island family.

2608.48 2623.52HOST:  Vic calls an end to his fishing strike and heads out on his own to catch dinner for the group.

2624.96 2628.48  VIC:  Nice and steady, nice and fucking steady. All the ground.
2628.80 2631.04  VIC:  All good, all good. All good.

2631.04 2640.56HOST:   It's been three days since the men had anything substantial to eat and they are obsessing about food.

2641.52 2647.28 WILL: I saw this documentary about some women that were still breastfeeding kids at the age of, was it three, four?
2648.00 2650.96 DAN: I always think that the longer you're on the breast, the better.
2652.00 2658.24 WILL: What, eight, nine? 
DAN: Yeah, I think if you're taking off the breast too early, it stunts your growth
2661.68 2663.68 VIC: Well, hello.
2663.68 2665.68  VIC:   Hey.
2665.68 2667.68  VIC:   Gentlemen. Yes, Vic.
2667.68 2669.68  VIC:   How are we all?

2669.68 2671.68 FARMAR: What you get Vic.
2671.68 2675.44  VIC:  I wish I had a fish for each of us, but alas, I don't.
2676.64 2686.00  VIC:  What I can say though is this. Of the five fish I've caught, two are the biggest I have ever caught in all my life.
ALL CHEERING 
2686.00 2693.76  VIC:   And one of them is the size of a small dog.
2697.36 2699.36  VIC:   Daddy brought home the bacon.
ALL: CHEERING
2699.36 2703.36  VIC:   They are massive, Vicars.
2703.36 2705.36  ALL:   For he's a jolly good fella.
2705.36 2707.36  ALL:   For he's a jolly good fella.
2707.36 2709.36 ALL:  For he's a jolly good fella.
2709.36 2711.36  ALL:   And so say all of us.

2712.96 2714.96 DAN: He's back to normal, Vic Fellows.
2715.04 2719.28 SPEAKER_05  Shoutering and whooping and getting fish and stuff like that, everything that he loves.

2719.28 2721.28  VIC:  Look at the size of that bitch.
PIERS: OOH
2726.80 2730.72 DAN Frippster will SAIL again. Frippster two will SAIL again.
2731.52 2733.52 SAM: I can't get this Titanic themed to it in my head.
2733.52 2735.52 DAN: That was like Titanic.
2735.52 2737.52 DAN: See, if I was Kate Winslet, who was Leonardo?
2737.52 2741.52 DAN: LAUGHTER Oh, it's...
2741.52 2743.52  DAN: Oh, love, love, love.

2743.52 2747.52 SAM: Sometimes I like to smash him repeatedly in the face, but...
2747.52 2750.52 SAM:  I think me and Vic were in danger of becoming quite good friends.
2750.52 2752.52 SAM:  Huge respect for the guy.
2752.52 2754.52 SAM:  CHEERING

2754.52 2756.52 ALL: VIC! VIC! VIC!
2756.52 2760.52  VIC:   Whoo! When in doubt, send Vic out.
