129.52 145.76 PHIL: (Black, Bald, CAR SALES): I personally don't think men are as strong now as they were, I wouldn't even say 50 years ago, even five years ago. to:camera
145.76 147.48 PHIL: Because we have it too easy. to:camera
147.48 152.64 PHIL: The interesting question to ask actually is if we lost everything what would happen to us? To:camera

152.64 162.64 BARNEY:(Paramedic, Short Blonde Hair, White, Hazel Eyes) It would be nice to think I've come off the island feeling a little bit more macho, a little bit more alpha male, a little bit more popular with the ladies. to:camera
162.64 170.44 HOST: I'm about to abandon these men on a remote Pacific island to see if they can survive. 
170.44 171.84 HOST: They will be utterly alone.

171.84 175.72 VIC:  (Cleaning Facilities Manager, White, Glasses, absolute schnozzer) My oldest last 19 is at university, he only needs me for money and a lift.  to:camera
175.72 178.00 VIC:  And the only response is too cool to run around with dad.

184.20 187.64 JOE:  (Graphic Designer, White, Blonde, Young) I don't think I've done anything that's put myself at risk really. to:camera
187.64 192.20 JOE:  But I'm scared he's sticking a graph of his island on an island with no other skills whatsoever. to:camera
192.20 194.04 JOE:  Anything could happen. to:camera
194.04 200.08 HOST  These 14 ordinary men do not know each other and they have no experience in living in the wild.

200.08 203.44 PAUL:  (Building Site Manager, White, Brown Hair, Big) At the moment I don't enjoy day to day life. to:camera
203.44 211.00 PAUL:  I've got a stressful job, I've got a newborn baby at home, I want to go out on the island to get away from the day to day bullshit.  To:camera

223.76 226.76 HOST Okay guys we're getting closer.
226.76 228.76 HOST You are very remote here.
228.76 233.28 HOST The next stop that way is New Zealand.
233.28 245.64 HOST  What I want to find out is, has all of this cushioning that civilization has experienced over the last 50 years made us totally lose touch with that survival instinct that I believe is deep within us all. To:camera
245.64 250.88 HOST  Okay guys I need you to be my eyes for any rocks, there are loads of rocks here. To:all
250.88 256.36 HOST  It takes an extreme situation to find out what people are really made of.
256.36 263.84 HOST  What you're about to embark on, it will be the toughest thing you will ever do. To:all
263.84 265.92 HOST  You can do this, alright?
265.92 266.92 HOST  You can do it. To: THE MEN
268.72 275.60 HOST  The men's home for the next six weeks is an uninhabited island in a remote Pacific archipelago. To: narration

275.60 284.40 HOST  The 11km of coastline is dominated by treacherous cliffs and rocky headless.
284.40 289.32 HOST  Fisher swells and powerful ocean currents means there's no easy way onto the island. To: narration

289.32 293.88 HOST  I'm going to try and get you guys as close as I can, alright? To:all
293.88 296.76 HOST  But you will end up swimming.To:all
296.76 301.00 HOST  I'll give you guys are weak swimmers, it is a good time to say.To:all
301.00 305.76 PHIL: I've never swam this distance before, not even in a swimming pool, but I will get there.To:all

305.76 307.08 PHIL: Age won't stop me doing this.To:camera
307.08 316.12 PHIL: Not often in one's life someone actually challenges your morals, challenges you physically and this does, that's why I want to do it. To:camera

316.12 318.32 PHIL: Who can't swim confidently?
318.32 319.88 PHIL: Confident with unconfident, yeah?
319.88 320.88 PHIL: Let's go.
320.88 321.88 SPEAKER_15 (old guy)  Woo hoo!
322.88 328.88 HOST  The men must make the 75m swim to the island fully clothed.
328.88 331.88 HOST Help each other, help those who are weaker. To:all
331.88 332.88 HOST Get off the back, get off the back. To:all
332.88 333.88 HOST Let's go, let's go. To:all

337.88 341.88 HOST  Strong undercurrents mean the men need to get to shore as quickly as possible. To:narration
341.88 343.88 HOST Kitty!
343.88 345.88 HOST You're doing good, go on mate.
345.88 347.88 HOST Keep going, keep going.
347.88 350.88 HOST Go, go, go, go.
356.88 359.88 VIC: That was the damnedest thing I ever did.
361.88 363.88 SPEAKER_16  I couldn't have gotten much better.
363.88 366.88 SPEAKER_16  Well that's only a taste of what we got to come then.
366.88 368.88 SPEAKER_16  Bring it on more than nature. To: ?
369.88 371.88 SPEAKER_07  Hey, what are you doing? To: barney
371.88 376.88 BARNEY: Well the advice is to save your own pits, which is a bit unnerving. To:camera?
376.88 380.88 HOST  With only two days survival training, initiative will be key. 
380.88 382.88 BARNEY: Essentially it's water isn't it? To:camera
382.88 383.88 PAUL: Is that your piss mate?
383.88 384.88 SPEAKER_07  You're not saving anything are you?
384.88 386.88 PAUL:  Yeah, yeah, saving your piss.
386.88 387.88 PAUL:  You're not being told anyway.
387.88 388.88 PAUL:  Save your piss.
388.88 389.88 BARNEY:  Drink your own piss? To:camera
389.88 390.88 BARNEY I hope not. To:camera

390.88 394.88 HOST  So they look a bit like a part of drowned rats at the moment. To:cam
394.88 396.88 HOST  Kind of let the chaos begin. 
396.88 409.88 HOST  But what I do know is when I return in six weeks time, the 14 men, if there's still 14 men there, which to be honest, I doubt. the men that do remain will be changed. To:cam
410.88 413.88 HOST  It's time for me and the crew to leave. To:cam
413.88 416.88 HOST  We won't be back until the end of the experiment. 
418.88 423.88 HOST  For the next six weeks, the men will have to live entirely on their own wits.
424.88 434.88 HOST  To make sure these men at least have a fighting chance of survival, I've ensured the island's got enough water, indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive. To:cam
434.88 441.88 HOST  It's teeming with wildlife, but what they've got to have is an ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill it. To:cam

441.88 442.88 PAUL: Pushing him in.  To:cam
442.88 443.88 SPEAKER_07  Can you get in?
443.88 444.88 HOST  Pull, pull, pull.
444.88 445.88 HOST  That's all right.
445.88 450.88 HOST  From here on in, everything you see will be filmed by the men themselves.
451.88 462.88 PAUL:  Why don't we get everybody together and then we're just all doing we're workout something that we're going to do and then we're all going to be heading that way, I'm assuming anyway, because it looks a little bit safer than this.  To:all
462.88 464.88 PAUL:  It'll be dark soon.
464.88 467.88 SPEAKER_07  Come on, lads, let's make use of some of this energy while we've got it.
467.88 472.88 HOST  All of the men will film before the group are trained and experienced camera operators.
472.88 475.88 HOST  How are you doing, mate?
475.88 479.88 HOST  Who'll be living under exactly the same conditions as everyone else.
479.88 482.88 VIC: Oh, I'm like a fucking mule, Orsana.
483.88 485.88 VIC: The brains of a donkey. 
485.88 493.88 PAUL:  Obviously, because we are having to film everything ourselves, we've got to cart all of the camera gear, batteries and everything with us.
494.88 496.88 PIERS:  Let's get on with it.
496.88 499.88 ANDY (51):  Fuck's sake, this is survival. Not good morning, Britain.
499.88 509.88 HOST  As well as the camera equipment, they'll have a medical kit, two jerry cans containing a day's supply of water, basic fishing equipment and a handful of tools. 


509.88 512.88 PIERS:  Guys, how many knives do we have? Let's count them in.  To:all
512.88 514.88 PIERS:  Three knives, three machetes.
To:all
514.88 516.88 BARNEY:  So I'll go the round in one group, guys.
516.88 519.88 BARNEY:  I'm Barney and I'm a paramedic from Leicester.
519.88 521.88 BARNEY:  Hello, man.


521.88 523.88 ANDY:  I'm Andy Bennett, builder from Milton Keynes.To:all
523.88 526.88 SPEAKER_00  We've got a fucking builder, everybody!
526.88 528.88 PIERS:  Let’s hope he’s not a cowboy.
529.88 531.88 PIERS:  My name's Piers, I am a doctor. To:all

533.88 536.88 KYLE:  I'm Kyle and I'm a website consultant. To:all  Note: No one cheered

540.88 543.88 PAUL:  My name's Paul, I invented the dice. Note: everyone laughed
546.88 549.88 PAUL:  I'm a construction contracts manager. To:all

550.88 558.88 HOST  It's 4pm. With only two hours of daylight remaining, the men's priority has to be finding a safe place to shelter for the night.
560.88 568.88 HOST  If they can't, they'll have to sleep rough on the jungle floor, alongside potentially deadly scorpions, snakes and caiman crocodiles.

569.88 575.88 PAUL:  We're assuming that the north side of the island would be nice beachy, sandy, flat seas. To: vic
575.88 578.88 HOST  Paul thinks the group's best option is a beach.
578.88 580.88 PAUL Let's go.
580.88 584.88 HOST  And he's convinced they have time to cross the island to find one before dark.
586.88 590.88 JOE:  Who else was imagining sunny beaches when they thought about coming out here?
590.88 592.88 JOE:  These trees here are very sharp.
593.88 595.88 PAUL:  There you go.
595.88 599.88 PAUL:  I believe it will now be referred to as the porcupine tree. Vicious.

600.88 606.88 HOST  The interior of the island is three square kilometres, a mangrove swamp, an unbroken jungle.
606.88 613.88 HOST  And I know from experience that moving through dense island undergrowth is slow, exhausting work.
613.88 616.88 HOST  It will do all you can to stop you in your tracks.
616.88 620.88 HOST  And often the harder you push, the harder it pushes back.

620.88 622.88 PAUL: Whale, stop!
624.88 626.88 SPEAKER_07  There's a snake down here. To: paul
626.88 628.88 SPEAKER_07  It's a boa, isn't it? To:
628.88 631.88 SPEAKER_07  Take its head off if it's a decent size, mate. Get stuck in.
631.88 633.88 PAUL:  Is anyone going to help me?
633.88 636.88 PAUL:  I'm trying to carry a bag and a machete and kill a snake.
636.88 639.88 SPEAKER_07 :  He's looking pretty aggressive. He's coiling, isn't he? To: paul
639.88 642.88 PAUL:  I need a long stick just to put on its head.
642.88 646.88 PAUL:  Mind you, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do that, for fuck's sake. To: JOE
646.88 648.88 ANDY:  Listen, shall we just throw this case on it? To: joe and paul
648.88 651.88 JOE:  No. Part of me thinks, shall we just leave it? To: Andy and paul
651.88 654.88 PAUL:  Didn't even flinch, did it? To: joe to andy
654.88 656.88 JOE:  Yeah, yeah, lets keep going. To:
657.88 661.88 JOE:  If we don't get out of this shrub, we're going to be sleeping here tonight. To: cam
661.88 663.88 JOE:  Ain't safe and it's not cool. To:cam

664.88 670.88 HOST  With just an hour to go until nightfall, the men have covered barely 400 metres.
670.88 672.88 VIC: Paul! Yes? To: paul
672.88 674.88 PAUL:  You're going to come and get a drink?
674.88 677.88 PAUL:  The darker it's getting, the more it's getting a little bit worried. To: camera
677.88 678.88 VIC:  Is that funny when you're done?
678.88 682.88 PAUL:  Somehow I've fallen into chief navigator mode, but I'm on it. To:camera
683.88 685.88 PAUL:  My days are very stressful. To:camera
686.88 689.88 PAUL:  It really doesn't fucking matter. I don't give a fuck. To:camera
689.88 692.88 PAUL:  A lot of the time I think that most people are fucking idiots. To:camera
692.88 694.88 PAUL:  Just get that load, yeah? Get that load, yeah? To:camera
694.88 696.88 PAUL:  You can't build the internal walls anyway. To:coworker
696.88 702.88 PAUL:  Being called a bastard is just a sort of friendly greeting in the building industry. To: cam
702.88 704.88 PAUL:  Get in there and get it done. To:cam
704.88 707.88 PAUL:  This experience might change me.
707.88 711.88 PAUL:  Hopefully for the better it might make me be a little bit more tolerant of other people.

711.88 713.88 PAUL:  Come on, fuckers.To: all
714.88 716.88 PAUL:  This is going to take us fucking hours.To: all
716.88 718.88 JOE:  Yeah, it's about to get darker and darker as well.
718.88 721.88 PAUL:  Yeah, I know. So that's why we've just got to get through it. To: joe
721.88 729.88 JOE:  We need to start to think, do we want to be hacking through this stuff when it's pitch black, or at the next time we see a clearing, are we going to think about settling down for the night? To: paul
729.88 732.88 PAUL:  I personally want to just plough on and make it. To:joe
732.88 736.88 PAUL:  I mean, it's going to get darker in here quicker than it is on the beach. To:joe
736.88 738.88 PAUL:  I say we plough on.To: joe
738.88 741.88 JOE:  This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. To:camera Note: Upset

744.88 746.88 JOE:  I haven't had to say right now. To:cam
748.88 750.88 JOE:  I never had the money to go travelling. To:cam
750.88 755.88 JOE:  I never done anything that's been a bit sort of edgy, that's been a bit… To:cam
755.88 757.88 JOE:  dangerous, I guess.To:cam
757.88 763.88 JOE:  I don't think I'm as confident as I say I am, and I think a lot of what I do can be a front. To:cam
763.88 768.88 JOE:  The sort of persona of Alpha Male to me is everything my stepdad was.To:cam
768.88 771.88 JOE:  I saw enough of him growing up to realise who not to be.
771.88 774.88 JOE:  I guess it's time to find out who I really am. To:cam
774.88 777.88 PAUL: Keep coming, we're only 100 metres away! To:all

777.88 786.88 DAN:  I keep seeing things like the beach is a little bit bigger, so I'm getting a little bit pissed off because I've been walking through about fucking miles, and it's not here. To:cam 
786.88 788.88 DAN: The tempers are free. To:

788.88 793.88 HOST  At the back, 51-year-old builder Andy is struggling to keep up.
793.88 796.88 ANDY The line looks like every man for himself. To: cam
796.88 798.88 ANDY:  For fuck's sake.
799.88 801.88 ANDY:  First cut. Note: Injured
805.88 810.88 JOE:  We've neither made any ground, and we are all fucked. To:cam

849.88 852.88 ANDY:  We could all do that like a hero with a machete.

854.88 857.88 ANDY:  I know we all want to get on, but...
857.88 859.88 ANDY:  You've got to think of everybody else now we're a team.
859.88 862.88 ANDY:  You can't just be selfish, you know?
Note: Andy beefing with Paul, dislikes that Paul isn’t waiting for the rest of the group

Day 2

968.88 969.88 CHARLIE: You all right?
969.88 971.88 CHARLIE: About two minutes sleep, I think, one time. 
972.88 978.88 HOST  16 hours ago, I dropped 14 ordinary British men on a remote desert island.

978.88 981.88 ANDY: I've been set for a minute. To: cam
981.88 983.88 ANDY One minute. 
983.88 987.88 HOST  They have spent their first night on the beach with no shelter.

988.88 990.88 PIERS:  That's not really shit.
990.88 992.88 VIC:  Oh, what have we done? To: cam
995.88 1000.88 VIC:  Did we get that realisation you've done something you didn't quite think all the way through?
1000.88 1003.88 VIC:  At one point, I was shitting it, and we were going to get washed away.
1003.88 1005.88 VIC:  I was like, did it get that close?
1005.88 1008.88 PIERS:  You can see the line, mate. You can see the line. To: cam
1008.88 1010.88 PIERS:  The line's what? Three foot away from everywhere? To: cam
1011.88 1013.88 PHIL: Look at that. To: cam
1013.88 1015.88 PHIL: A rubbish on this beach.
1015.88 1018.88 PIERS:  Has anyone found a left shoe? To: phil / all
1018.88 1021.88 PAUL:  Yeah, but these, I'm not too sure if I'm going to go for these.
1021.88 1023.88 PIERS:  Oh, you! To: paul
1023.88 1024.88 PAUL:  A bit last season. To: all
1024.88 1027.88 PIERS:  Hey, lads, look. Found a pink pair.
1027.88 1028.88 PAUL:  Yeah!
1028.88 1030.88 PIERS:  These are bloody comfortable. To: all
1031.88 1033.88 PAUL:  Look at these bad boys.
1033.88 1035.88 PAUL:  This is the male version.

Day time
1035.88 1043.88 HOST  The men came onto the island with just a day's supply of drinking water.
1043.88 1045.88 HOST  No mouthfuls.
1045.88 1050.88 HOST  But after yesterday's arduous trek in 34 degree heat, it's all but gone.
1050.88 1059.88 HOST  Tropical storm season, really, there shouldn't be any shortage of water on the island, and obviously rain itself is drinkable without purification.
1059.88 1063.88 HOST  But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated.
1063.88 1065.88 HOST  All sorts of bacteria and nasties there.
1065.88 1070.88 HOST  From experience, I can tell you, animals aren't fussy about where they crap.

1072.88 1073.88 DAN:  Oh, my God. To: cam
1073.88 1077.88 DAN:  Without a crap that's in there, it's fucking horrible.
1077.88 1083.88 HOST  Without boiling, this rancid water would almost certainly give the men stomach cramps and diarrhea.
1083.88 1085.88 DAN It's not salty, but...
1085.88 1088.88 JOE:  I'll tell you what, I've had hungover shits that smelled better than that.
1088.88 1092.88 PIERS:  Guys, can we... Why don't we all kind of gather in and have some sort of conflab? To: all
1092.88 1094.88 PIERS:  about what were going to do today.
1094.88 1096.88 KYLE:  Yeah, I think that might be a very good idea, please. To: all
1096.88 1097.88 VIC:  Go on, guys, gather out.
1097.88 1098.88 PIERS:  Like plan of action, that.
1098.88 1099.88 VIC:  Yeah.

1099.88 1102.88 DAN:  We 100% need to try and make a fire now.
1102.88 1109.88 SAM: If we don't make a fire and something to boil new water, we're going to be in bad shape by tomorrow morning. To: all
1109.88 1112.88 DAN: Food is becoming a priority very quickly for a lot of people. To: all
1112.88 1116.88 SPEAKER_12  We're going to have to get something substantial to eat fairly soon.
1116.88 1117.88 SPEAKER_12  Right, meeting adjourned. To:all

Note: Dan and Andy stay behind 

1135.88 1138.88 DAN It's quite a lot of pressure to get this fire going. To: cam

1143.88 1144.88 ANDY:  Awesome.
1144.88 1146.88 DAN: That is not an ideal start, is it? To: andy
1146.88 1147.88 DAN: That it was drunk.
1147.88 1149.88 DAN: Oh, lads.
1149.88 1150.88 ANDY:  I shot my load. To: cam

1157.88 1164.88 HOST  Along the coast, 47-year-old Vic has decided to put Joe, the group's youngest member, to work. To: vic -> joe 

1164.88 1166.88 JOE: We should definitely have put some fucking shoes on.
1166.88 1168.88 VIC:  That might have been a wise idea, fella.
1168.88 1169.88 JOE:  Oh!
1169.88 1172.88 VIC:  Just anything, Olympics, crabs, give them a crack.
1172.88 1175.88 VIC:  Snails, you spot them, fella, and I'll club them.
1175.88 1177.88 VIC:  Do these snails bite? To: cam
1177.88 1180.88 VIC:  I feel something with legs is going to come out of there, isn't it? To: cam
1180.88 1181.88 VIC:  Nip it.
1181.88 1185.88 VIC:  Don't put your finger where you want to put your dick, because it might get bitched. To: joe
1185.88 1190.88 SPEAKER_07  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how the nearest we get to Michelin's star.
1190.88 1192.88 SPEAKER_07  Will we put it on a bed of anything?

1198.88 1199.88 HOST  One.
1200.88 1204.88 HOST  A morning's hard graft provides nothing more than a handful of limpets.
1204.88 1205.88 HOST  Yeah.
1208.88 1209.88 None  Come on.
1214.88 1215.88 KYLE:  Give it a good old cheer. To: andy

1220.88 1221.88 BARNEY: Aw.
1221.88 1223.88 BARNEY: Horrendous.
1223.88 1225.88 SPEAKER_10  You don't buy them in supermarkets, do you?
1225.88 1227.88 SPEAKER_10  So they're not known for being very nice.
1227.88 1229.88 SPEAKER_10  I don't think they're very nice at all.
1231.88 1233.88 HOST  For now, the men will have to go hungry.
1234.88 1235.88 ANDY Stop. To: dan
1236.88 1238.88 ANDY:  Who said there's no smoke without fire? To: dan
1238.88 1239.88 DAN:  Lying bastards. To: Andy
1239.88 1241.88 PIERS:  Fates spits me off a little bit.
1242.88 1244.88 DAN:  I just don't know what we're doing wrong. To: cam

1245.88 1249.88 HOST  Lighting a fire has become an urgent priority.
1249.88 1255.88 HOST  It's 34 degrees in the shade, and the men have had little to drink in the past 12 hours.

<all drinking clean water together>

1413.24 1414.24 VIC:  It's almost like normal water.
1414.24 1417.24 SPEAKER_10  There's a bit of sort of pond in there.
1417.24 1419.12 SPEAKER_17  That is top notch.
1419.12 1422.84 SPEAKER_17  It doesn't taste like piss, does it?
1422.84 1423.84 ANDY: It's like mile way tea.
1424.72 1429.64 HOST  As long as the fire stays lit, the men will have a source of safe drinking water.

1429.64 1431.64 KYLE: It's tough to that.
1431.64 1432.64 KYLE: It's tough to that.
1432.64 1434.64 DAN: What an achievement, yeah?  To: cam
1434.64 1439.64 HOST  But keeping it alight during tropical storm season will be a huge challenge.

1445.64 1447.64 SAM:  And then...

1450.64 1453.64 PAUL:  And it's like weight shows in Aldi all in one picture.

1456.64 1462.64 PAUL:  What I'm worried about is everyone's off doing other things and in a minute it's going to be pissing down with rain. To: ALL
1462.64 1466.64 PAUL:  I actually think it would be quite important to build a shelter for the fire.
1466.64 1470.64 ANDY:  I've not got the energy to build a shelter or anything at the moment. To: ALL
1470.64 1471.64 ANDY:  If I could, I would.
1471.64 1472.64 ANDY:  I promise you.
1473.64 1475.64 PAUL:  A little bit worried about Andy.
1475.64 1479.64 PAUL:  He seems to have separated himself from the group a little bit. To:  CAM(SELF VLOG)
1479.64 1485.64 PAUL:  When everybody's together hes walked off, he's now making a bed over there, which just seems a bit childish.
Note: PAUL IS NOT HAPPY WITH ANDY, THINKS HE DOESN’T WANT TO BE PART OF THE GROUP
1485.64 1488.64 PAUL:  Feels like he doesn't want to be part of the group. 
1488.64 1489.64 ANDY:  Hey, hey, I've got a bed.
1489.64 1492.64 ANDY:  All I want to do at the moment is get some sleep.
1492.64 1494.64 ANDY:  Just some, you know?

1498.64 1500.64 ANDY:  I think middle age has made me boring. To:  CAMERA
1500.64 1503.64 ANDY:  I've got a beautiful wife, lovely house, nice job, etc.
1503.64 1506.64 ANDY:  All the stuff that most people strive to get.
1506.64 1508.64 ANDY:  And yet I'm still searching for something.
1508.64 1510.64 ANDY:  Perhaps all men get like that.
1510.64 1511.64 ANDY:  I don't know.
1511.64 1512.64 ANDY:  Perhaps I'm at a midlife crisis.
1512.64 1514.64 ANDY:  I don't like myself as much as I used to.
1514.64 1516.64 ANDY:  Put it that way.
1516.64 1520.64 ANDY:  I think I need a new adventure to put that right.
Note: Lying down relaxing

1548.64 1551.64 PAUL:  We've got no cover over it whatsoever. To: ALL
1551.64 1554.64 PAUL:  We've got nowhere to sleep whatsoever. To: ALL
1554.64 1559.64 PAUL:  So I would say our priority is shelter. To: ALL
1559.64 1564.64 PAUL:  Honestly, in the politest way of course, we need to cover up this fucking fire because it's going to go out. To: ALL
1564.64 1568.64 HOST  Without the fire, the men will have no means of purifying water to drink.

1568.64 1569.64 PHIL:  Who was doing the leaves? To: ALL
1569.64 1571.64 PHIL:  Is anybody getting the leaves to cover this? To: ALL

1575.64 1577.64 CHARLIE: Ah, clusterfuck or poo bar. To: CAM

1754.64 1759.64 HOST  You process thoughts, process memories, but when you don't get enough of it, that's when you become careless.
1759.64 1763.64 HOST  It affects your decision-making abilities and it can even lead to depression.

1791.64 1796.64 ROSS:  He's just kind of wandering around, sitting down, hitting his hands.
1796.64 1799.64 ROSS:  Kind of looks like he's feeling sorry for himself, will he?
1799.64 1801.64 ROSS:  And he's obviously missing home.

1855.64 1859.64 HOST  But both have a very different idea about where to put it.

Note: PAUL AND ANDY HAVE DIFFERING OPINIONS ON HOW TO BUILD THE SHELTER

1859.64 1862.64 CHARLIE: We need to pick a location to build this shelter on.
1862.64 1863.64 CHARLIE:   Put it.
1863.64 1865.64 CHARLIE:   We have two potential locations.
1865.64 1867.64 CHARLIE: Andy, is your place on the beach? TO: ANDY

1878.64 1879.64 ANDY:  Job's good.
1880.64 1881.64 ANDY:  This is not Andy's, is it?

1883.64 1889.64 SAM:  You're more exposed to the tide. You're more exposed to the weather, and we're going to get beaten to smotherings by sandplugs.
1889.64 1890.64 PAUL:  It's not an option.
1890.64 1891.64 PAUL:  No way.

1891.64 1894.64 SAM:  Andy's camp, it looks like it'll flood at the tidal surge.
1894.64 1897.64 SAM:  There's plastic bottles everywhere. I think we'll get bitten to shit.

Note: SAM  DOES NOT LIKE ANDY’S SHELTER AND DOES NOT TRUST IT

1898.64 1900.64 ANDY:  Pointless. Give me my opinion, mate.

1906.64 1910.64 PAUL:  I would love to have come down here for Andy's sake and gone, this is fucking brilliant, mate.
1910.64 1915.64 PAUL:  The trouble is, we walked in here, and I kept my mouth shut, but within 30 seconds, everyone went, are you fucking joking?

1924.64 1928.64 HOST:  With Andy's sight rejected, Paul shows the men his preferred location.
1929.64 1933.64 PAUL: Because it's elevated, this is not really going to get that wet. TO:DAN
1933.64 1937.64 CHARLIE: It's got a fairly good canopy. We can all sleep here on the dry.

PAUL AND CHARLIE AGREE WITH THE SAME LOCATION AND LIKE IT
DAN LIKES THE LOCATION

1937.64 1939.64 PAUL:  Correct. You've got a nice little breeze coming through as well.
1939.64 1940.64 DAN:  Yeah, I like this place.
1943.64 1946.64 PAUL:  Well, what we need now is cross members.
1947.64 1959.64 SAM:  I'm a bit surprised about Paul being a volcanic rhinoceros, but you know what? He's single-minded, but he makes clear decisions and sticks by them, and he's been right more than he's been wrong so far.

Note: SAM is unsure about paul, not a huge fan, but hes been right most of the time

VIC HELPING JOE

2013.64 2022.64 JOE:  What do you say? Building camp, the top of a steep hill, in the middle of rainy season, is the stupidest idea ever had?

2040.64 2043.64 JOE:  Day one, I've been shouting orders at me from day dark.
2043.64 2047.64 JOE:  We're carrying stuff in and out of a jungle and I've got a heavy rucksack on my back.

2047.64 2049.64 JOE:  Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do this.
2049.64 2056.64 JOE:  You've not been shouting orders at anyone else, but I think you feel I'm the youngest, therefore naturally you've got some authority over me. TO: VIC

JOE THINKS ADVICE IS GIVEN TO HIM BECAUSE HE IS SEEN AS THE WEAKEST BY OTHERS (VIC)

2056.64 2058.64 JOE:  That's been grinding on me a little bit.
2058.64 2066.64 VIC:  Joe intimated that I'd been giving him a hard time, which I truly have only tried to be positive with everybody. TO: SELF

VIC HAD NO BAD INTENTIONS, AND IS SAD ABOUT HOW JOE FEELS

2362.64 2363.64 PAUL:  Where's the bit of wood?

2411.64 2412.64 PAUL:  I haven't asked it four times.
2412.64 2413.64 ANDY:  You asked.
2413.64 2414.64 PAUL:  I said, why do you want to go home?
2414.64 2415.64 PAUL:  You went, because I do.
2415.64 2416.64 PAUL:  I went, well, give us a reason.
2416.64 2417.64 PAUL:  You went, I'm not going to give you a reason.
2417.64 2418.64 ANDY:  Exactly.
2418.64 2419.64 ANDY:  So then you asked again, and then you asked again, and then you asked again
2419.64 2420.64 PAUL:  I said, so there must be a reason.
2420.64 2421.64 PAUL:  I didn't ask again, Andy.
2421.64 2422.64 ANDY:  You did.
2422.64 2423.64 PAUL:  What is the fucking matter with you?
2423.64 2425.64 ANDY:  Nothing that matters with me, sir.
2425.64 2426.64 ANDY:  At all.

NOTE: Andy and Paul are not happy

2428.64 2430.64 VIC:  Do we wedge that there and then prop it up? TO:PAUL
2430.64 2432.64 PAUL:  Whatever Andy wants to do.
2432.64 2433.64 PAUL:  I've had enough.
Note: Paul fed up with Andy, Paul storms off into the woods
2434.64 2435.64 PIERS:  Hang on.
2435.64 2436.64 PIERS:  They need your expertise. TO: PAUL
2440.64 2441.64 ANDY:  I said stop asking me.
2441.64 2442.64 ANDY:  And canny not stop asking me?
2444.64 2445.64 ANDY:  Fucking unbelievable.
2449.64 2454.64 HOST  With the camp's two builders walking off the job, construction of the shelter grinds to a halt.

2457.64 2461.64 HOST  There's no doubt there's a lot of strong, pretty macho personalities on the men's island.
2461.64 2464.64 HOST  And yeah, they're all trying to find their place in that pecking order.
2464.64 2471.64 HOST  But the danger when you get these high pressure situations like this is that the alpha males start to compete instead of cooperate.
2471.64 2474.64 HOST  And then the danger is it blows a whole group apart.

2474.64 2476.64 PAUL:  I used to be in control. TO: ???
2476.64 2479.64 PAUL:  I used to walk, being organized, everything running efficiently.
2479.64 2480.64 PAUL:  It's what I do.

Note: PAUL AND ANDY mad again, trying to get people to their own sides
2481.64 2483.64 ANDY:  That ignorant twat wants to do his way.
2483.64 2484.64 ANDY:  Yeah.
2484.64 2485.64 ANDY:  And he hasn't got a fucking clue.
2485.64 2487.64 ANDY:  It makes your head.
2487.64 2488.64 ANDY:  It's like he wants to implode.
2488.64 2490.64 ANDY:  Seriously, my work is a punch to the throat.
2490.64 2492.64 ANDY:  He's down, gone, finished.
2492.64 2493.64 ANDY:  It's over with.
2493.64 2494.64 ANDY:  I walk away.
2494.64 2495.64 ANDY:  Happy days.
2495.64 2496.64 ANDY:  I can't do that here.
2496.64 2497.64 ANDY:  Bang, done.
2497.64 2498.64 ANDY:  Fat cunt.
2498.64 2499.64 ANDY:  You know what I mean?

2505.64 2509.64 SAM: There's a lot of bad blood in camp at the minute, largely between Paul and Andy.
2509.64 2514.64 SAM: We've got enough on our plate in this island without alpha male dick tween. TO:CAM

Note: Sam and Dan are mad at both of them

2515.64 2519.64 DAN:  I think everyone just needs to motherfucker up, really.
2521.64 2526.64 ANDY:  I just feel like everything I do, like, he's just there, ready to fucking knock it down, you know, criticize.
2526.64 2529.64 ANDY:  It's like, fuck off, you know? TO: PIERS
2529.64 2532.64 ANDY:  If he goes ill stay, people won't make problems. TO: PIERS

Note: Paul overhears Andy talking to Piers about getting rid of him
2538.64 2541.64 PAUL:  So, I overheard a conversation with Andy.
2541.64 2546.64 PAUL:  His exact words were, if Paul leaves, that'd be good, because then I will stay.
2546.64 2549.64 PAUL:  I'm not dealing with that sort of immaturity.
2549.64 2550.64 PAUL:  He's supposed to be a grown man.
2550.64 2551.64 PAUL:  I'm not being blackmailed.
2551.64 2554.64 PAUL:  I don't need to be surrounded by this immaturity.
2554.64 2556.64 PAUL:  I might just have to go.

2556.64 2558.64 PIERS Are you thinking about fucking off?
2558.64 2560.64 PAUL:  Can't be fucking bothered. TO: ALL / PIERS
2560.64 2562.64 PIERS:  You can't go, mate.
2562.64 2563.64 PIERS:  You literally can't go.
2563.64 2565.64 DAN:  Do you think that you would regret it later on? TO: PAUL
2565.64 2566.64 PIERS:  You will regret it.
2566.64 2567.64 CHARLIE: I think I won't.
2567.64 2568.64 CHARLIE: Just suck it up, mate.
2568.64 2569.64 CHARLIE: Lift up your skirt.
2569.64 2572.64 VIC:  Wash the sand out of your vagina, mate.

Note: PIERS, DAN AND CHARLIE LIKE PAUL, THEY WANT HIM TO STAY

2573.64 2581.64 HOST  In a disastrous turn of events, three men, including the island's two builders, are now threatening to walk.

WILL

2581.64 2588.64 FARMAR: Andy, Paul and Joe all want to leave this island.
2588.64 2592.64 FARMAR: I'm amazed that they've come this far and want to give up so early.

2600.64 2605.64 HOST  As yet another storm hits the island, the men call a crisis meeting.

2605.64 2613.64 PHIL: I know it sounds cutthroat, and we need to keep as many of those guys here as we can, but for any of them to change their mind is a win. TO:CAM

2614.64 2617.64 FARMAR: There's been so much discussion about people leaving.
2617.64 2622.64 FARMAR: My personal opinion is that we are stronger together than we are apart.
2622.64 2623.64 SPEAKER_10  Agreed. ALL
2623.64 2626.64 WILL: Joe, my hope is that you might have thought differently of a knife.
2626.64 2627.64 JOE:  I've already had the chat with everyone. TO: DOE
2627.64 2628.64 JOE:  People have already said the thoughts.
2628.64 2632.64 JOE:  I've already said my thoughts, but on that note, I will be saying no more.
2632.64 2634.64 JOE:  I'll just be waiting for the boat to arrive and to leave.
2634.64 2635.64 JOE:  OK?
2637.64 2640.64 FARMER: Paul, would you just let us know how you're feeling at the moment?
2640.64 2646.64 PAUL:  I came to this island as a bit of a release, you know, to get away from my everyday life. TO: FARMAR/ ALL
2646.64 2648.64 PAUL:  I'm not really confrontational.
2648.64 2650.64 PAUL:  I don't like having arguments with people.
2650.64 2653.64 PAUL:  I'd rather just step away from the situation.
2653.64 2666.64 PAUL:  The final nail in the coffin was to hear somebody say that, it was good that I was going, which I thought was a bit of a shame, but in another way, it confirmed my decision.
2666.64 2669.64 PAUL:  And in that case, that's why I decided to go.

2669.64 2671.64 CHARLIE:  If one goes, there's no point in the other going?
2671.64 2672.64 PAUL:  Right, here we go.
2672.64 2673.64 CHARLIE:  How do we make that decision?
2673.64 2674.64 PAUL:  Here we go.
2674.64 2676.64 PAUL:  This is now we're getting to the country.
2676.64 2679.64 PAUL:  He segregated himself from the group from day one.
2679.64 2681.64 PAUL:  We're having a discussion. He doesn't want to know.
2681.64 2684.64 PAUL:  We haven't got any beds. He makes himself a bed.
2684.64 2685.64 PAUL:  He goes off and sulks.
2685.64 2687.64 PAUL:  Somehow that's my fault.
2687.64 2688.64 ANDY:  I've had no sleep before, Dave.
2688.64 2689.64 PAUL:  Neither has anybody.
2689.64 2690.64 ANDY:  You've had a fault.
2690.64 2691.64 ANDY:  You've been sleeping.
2691.64 2693.64 ANDY:  Sorry, mate. You've been sleeping.
2693.64 2695.64 ANDY Andy, nobody's had any sleep.
2695.64 2701.64 PHIL: As a group, no one here has had enough sleep to give them the energy to do what they've had to do the next day.
2701.64 2705.64 PHIL So you pointing a finger at me and saying, well, you've had sleep, fine. That's your problem.

ANDY TARGETS PHIL
Note: Phil does not like Andy after Andy said he was sleeping

2705.64 2709.64 PAUL I've been having a laugh up until I heard one of my teammates say
2709.64 2712.64 PAUL:  they wanted me to go. I was having a right crack.
2712.64 2713.64 PAUL Now I'm not.

2713.64 2716.64 WILL: In a community, not everyone gets on.
2716.64 2719.64 WILL: And that is a fact of life. We can't change that.
2720.64 2722.64 WILL: So let's build our community.
2722.64 2725.64 WILL: You and you just keep your distance.
2725.64 2727.64 WILL: At least we're together. We're two men up.
2727.64 2731.64 WILL: We can build a shelter in a day rather than taking two days with two men down.
2731.64 2733.64 WILL: The big strong man and the builder.
2733.64 2736.64 WILL: You two fuck off, then we're fucked, aren't we? TO:ALL

Note: Whoever this guy is the group listened to him

2736.64 2739.64 CHARLIE: See, I don't want to lose two builders, regardless of your character.
2739.64 2742.64 SPEAKER_17  We need you to stay.
2742.64 2745.64 PAUL:  I'm going to walk away and then that would hopefully...
2745.64 2752.64 PAUL:  No, listen. So Andy can enjoy his experience and hopefully five, then you're not losing two people, are you?
2752.64 2753.64 PAUL:  You're losing one.
2753.64 2755.64 ANDY:  I'm leaving the island.
2755.64 2757.64 SPEAKER_17:  Whether Paul leaves are not.
2757.64 2760.64 ANDY:  Whether Paul leaves or not. I would rather Paul stay.
2760.64 2764.64 ANDY:  If a strong man and me, he'll be more benefit to you.
2764.64 2767.64 ANDY:  But either way, I'm sorry I'm going.
2767.64 2770.64 PAUL:  For him to fucking say, I'm glad he's going.
2770.64 2776.64 PAUL:  Good, then I'll stay, then all of a sudden he hasn't got his own way again and it's, oh, I'm going, there's other reasons.
2776.64 2778.64 PAUL:  It's fucking immaturity.
2778.64 2781.64 PAUL:  It's soaking and it's detention seeking.
2781.64 2783.64 PAUL:  And you don't want to be scapegoat. I really like this.
2783.64 2789.64 PAUL:  I'm not having it. I am going off this island because I'm not being held responsible for that.
2789.64 2791.64 PAUL:  End of story.
