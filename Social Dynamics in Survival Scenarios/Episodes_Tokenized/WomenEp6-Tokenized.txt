0.00 7.00 HOST:  Two uninhabited Pacific Islands. More than 5,000 miles from the UK. One will be inhabited
14.00 56.64 HOST:  by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British women. For six weeks they will be utterly alone. With only the clothes they stand up in, fishing equipment and a handful of basic tools. Filming everything themselves. That is awesome! When pushed to the limits of human endurance, will it be brute power or mental strength that wins the day? Daddy Bro, on the bacon! Who will have what it takes to stay alive? Tonight is the final instalment of the women's island. People want to be on camera today. Anybody
56.64 63.64 SPEAKER_13  films me, I'll pick up. Survival will be harder than ever. The search for food is now a matter
65.64 93.64 HOST:   of life and death. It's a shark! Living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season. I think we are on our last leg. When pushed to the limits of human endurance, will be pitted against the extremes of nature. Hang on! Oh shit! With the finishing line in sight, will these Monday women go what it takes to survive? I'll do what I want to
93.64 106.64 JAMIE:  do. I cannot stand there and go, I'm not going to do it. Let me finish. As usual, arguments have started. Fucking want to get fucking off here and it better be fucking soon.
110.64 117.64 HOST: After nearly five weeks on the island, the ten remaining women were on the verge of failure.
124.64 135.64 HOST:   They were dangerously dehydrated and had an urgent medical warning. We're going to have to pull the plug on this. That their lives were at risk. We are in scary territory where
136.64 140.64 SPEAKER_05  we just don't know what's happening to our bodies. But they pulled themselves back from
140.64 147.64 SPEAKER_14  the brink. We got a fish! Oh my God, it's massive! Now entering their sixth week surviving
149.64 180.52 HOST:   on the island, food in the camp vicinity is running out. The starving women face a battle to make it to the end. 

INTRO ENDS

JULIE: Is it weird hitting them with a machete? 
BEKI: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
GEORGIE: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
HOST: Desperate for something to eat. Becky, Julie and Georgie brave the vicious incoming tide to scavenge the last remaining oysters.
Becky, Julie and Georgie scavenging oysters
195.64 202.64 BETH: Oh, bloody hell. Today I'm feeling like absolute shit. I know that I keep saying I feel like shit.
203.64 225.64 BETH: But today I feel like dried white dog poo shit. 

HOST: Since they have arrived on the island, the starving women have shed more than 140 pounds between them. The weight of an average woman. Our coconut supply is running low. 

225.64 239.64 BEKI:Our yucca around here is non-existent. The limes have now gone. The almond fruits that grow on the trees here, we've eaten all of those. We've eaten all of those. 

259.32 262.76 JAMIE: I want to get as much protein in me as I can. 
BELINDA: Yeah.
262.76 264.76 BELINDA: I just had a dirty thought.
264.76 271.72 BELINDA: I need to get a big fat sausage in you as soon as you can.
271.72 275.68 JAMIE: Sometimes I do eat meat, but only the sausage for that is.
275.68 280.76 JAMIE Sometimes I like a bit of churrito, but I don't like them chiclet.

280.76 284.84 GEORGIE Here, let me help you.
284.84 291.72 HOST: With food so scarce around camp, the rest of the women are having to rely solely on the fishing net they've set in the shallows.
291.72 295.04 GEORGIE: Ooh, I think he wants something in the net.
295.04 296.04 Julie: It's a shark.
296.04 297.04 GEORGIE: Where is it?
297.04 298.04 GEORGIE: Where is it?
298.04 299.04 GEORGIE: Where is it?
299.04 300.04 SPEAKER_07  That is unbelievable.
300.04 301.04 GEORGIE: I got him.
301.04 302.04 GEORGIE: QUICK, he's getting away.
302.04 303.04 GEORGIE: He's got away.
303.04 304.04 GEORGIE: He's got away.
304.04 305.04 GEORGIE: He's got away.
305.04 306.04 GEORGIE: He's got away.
306.04 307.04 FI: Oh, damn.
307.04 308.04 FI: Damn, damn, damn.
308.04 309.04 Julie: No supper for us tonight.

309.04 326.80 BEKI: There's ten of us, and I think we are on our last legs.

326.80 332.92 HOST: When Mother Nature slams that larder door firmly shut, things in a group can rapidly go downhill.
332.92 333.92 HOST: You're hungry.
333.92 336.16 HOST: You're despondent, and it's so tempting to give up.
336.16 343.76 HOST: But like so many things in life and in the wild, it's actually about how you respond to those crisis moments.


343.76 352.48 CHALAVA: I've literally been up almost all night trying to keep that fire alive.
352.48 358.52  HOST: From day one, the women have governed themselves in the leaderless community, trying to make group decisions.
358.52 359.52 JAMIE: What was it not enough wood?
359.52 360.52 JAMIE: Have you run out of wood now?
360.52 361.52 CHAVALA: We ran out of wood last night, and everyone went to...
361.52 362.52 JAMIE: You're chalking.
362.52 363.52  CHAVALA: Yeah.

363.52 367.28 FI: Because there's no... they need to fucking get wood.
367.28 368.28 FI: End of story.
368.28 370.28 FI: That's the bit I don't get.

370.28 372.56  CHAVALA: There's no leader.
372.56 374.64  CHAVALA: Not one person rules the roost.
374.64 381.48  CHAVALA: We work collectively, so we have to kind of use our initiative and work off that.
381.48 387.08 CHAVALA: So if, say, I want to go foraging, I don't have to be told to go foraging.
387.08 389.08 CHAVALA: I'm going to go foraging.

389.08 392.60 BELINDA: All the decisions we've made thus far have been made collaboratively.
392.60 401.88 BELINDA: We've not needed to conform to a system where there's a leader.

401.88 405.52 HOST: The women need to survive seven more days on the island.
405.52 409.28 HOST:   Any hope of dinner depends entirely on catching fish.
409.28 414.32 HOST:   The women are yet to establish a rotor for checking the nets, and Julie has made a discovery.

414.32 418.24 JULIE: The net isn't a right mess.
418.24 421.84 JULIE: It's just... it's curled over that tight.
421.84 424.12 JULIE: There's no teamwork.
424.12 427.52 JULIE: There's no organisation.
427.52 430.96 JULIE: There's nobody who wants responsibility for anything.

430.96 431.96 BELINDA: Holy shit.
431.96 432.96 LAUREN: It's an absolute state.
432.96 433.96 JAMIE I mean, have you seen that?
433.96 440.80 JAMIE: It's twisted, it's twisted, it's twisted.
440.80 446.84 HOST:   High stormy seas have destroyed their last hope of getting something to eat.
446.84 449.64 LAUREN: Fishing is the only thing that we survive off at the minute.
449.64 453.56 LAUREN: We need to get it sorted ASAP.
453.56 455.28 JAMIE: Just getting more and more tangled.
455.28 458.40 GEORGINA: Yeah, no, but just pulling it like that's going to rip it, isn't it?
458.40 459.40 JAMIE: No, it's not.
459.40 460.40 GEORGINA:  Well, it is, when everyone picks it up
461.40 462.40 JAMIE: Well...
462.40 465.40 JAMIE: Well, I'll just let you do it.
465.40 467.40 GEORGINA: Stop being a stroppy cow, Jamie.
467.40 468.40 GEORGINA:  What's the weird?
468.40 469.40 BELINDA: Where's Jamie gone?
469.40 470.40 JAMIE: Fucking money.
470.40 471.40 JAMIE: Fucking off, you.
471.40 480.40 JAMIE:  It better be fucking soon.

480.40 483.88 JAMIE:  I would say I've had a hard life growing up.
483.88 487.72 JAMIE:  My mum's got MS and she's been a careful.
487.72 494.96 JAMIE:  She's always said to me to basically live life to the full because she's never been able to do the things that I've done.
494.96 497.92 JAMIE:  It's made me extremely independent.
497.92 509.24 JAMIE:  So if someone was to start bossing me about, it would make me really upset and probably make me really angry.
509.24 510.24 JAMIE:  I'll do what I want.
510.24 512.92 JAMIE:  When I want, I don't want anybody telling me what to do.
512.92 513.92 JAMIE:  Bossing me about.
513.92 514.92 JAMIE:  Fed up.
514.92 519.44 JAMIE:  We have to do things that, you know, we don't always want to do, but it's for the team.
519.44 522.24 JAMIE:  I've had enough of fucking everything.
522.24 526.88 JAMIE: It's really a shit.

JULIE SPEAKING TO FI
526.88 533.88 JULIE: If anything's going to make me leave the sand, it's the people.
533.88 538.12 JULIE:  It's the work of the team.
538.12 543.12 FI:  Well, darling, I mean, I don't know what to say to you.
543.12 544.12 FI: I completely agree.
544.12 545.12 JULIE: I thought you were all going to be a team.
545.12 546.12 JULIE: work together.
546.12 547.12 JULIE: It's not like that at all.
547.12 554.12 FI: It's absolutely not like that at all.

554.36 558.20 HOST:   The effects of starvation on the body are not just physical.
558.20 566.36 HOST:   Extreme hunger makes people desperate, depressed, irritable, and all the negative emotions that women are experiencing will be amplified.
566.36 577.20 HOST:   And if there are rifts emerging now, what hunger will do will act like a crowbar, forcing those rifts further apart.

578.20 579.20 HOST: 6am.

579.20 586.20 BETH:  So, what's everybody doing? Can we just make it clear?
588.20 596.44 HOST:   Nobody's taken responsibility to set a fire rotor, so it's left to Beth and Lauren again to keep the embers going through the night.
596.44 598.72 BETH:  I'm sorting out the fire.
598.72 600.60 BETH:  You're sorting out your socks.
600.60 602.44 HOST:   While Jamie has slept.
602.44 603.44 BETH:  I think you should help.
603.44 605.44 JAMIE:  Right, well, do you know what?
605.68 606.68 JAMIE:  I can't be doing with us.
606.68 608.68 BETH:  Literally, you've got to bend over and get fucking twigged.
608.68 611.68 JAMIE:  Just stop fucking bossing me about, mate.

611.68 613.68 BETH:  Look, those rows hit.
613.68 617.68 BETH:  I want to show my daughter that I can be brave.
617.68 623.68 BETH:  I want to show her that there are endless possibilities and women can do anything.
623.68 630.68 BETH:  I'm hoping we're all going to group together and be a team, especially because it's just a group of women.
630.68 633.68 BETH:  I think we've all got a little bit of something to prove.

634.68 636.68 JAMIE:  I will help when I'm ready.
636.68 643.68 BETH:  I've been up all night with the friggin' fire, and I'm tired too, and you're sitting there sorting out your fucking feet.
643.68 645.68 BETH:  I've got socks on.
648.68 649.68 BETH:  Whatever.
650.68 651.68 BETH:  You’re fucking lazy.
651.68 653.68 BETH That really sucks me off, so.
653.68 655.68 FI: It's absolutely outrageous.
655.68 657.68 FI: We're all a bit fed up with Jamie.
657.68 659.68 FI: There, I've said it.
FLASHBACK?? BETH AND FI ARE FED UP WITH JAMIE

659.68 669.68 JAMIE:  It's really making me frustrated, and every time I stop, I feel like people are looking at me.
669.68 675.68 JAMIE:  Actually, you know, I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, and I don't know what.
675.68 679.68 JAMIE:  I think we're going to end up killing each other by the end of this, I really do.
681.68 683.68 GEORGIE: We are completely dysfunctional as a group.
683.68 691.68 GEORGIE: I find that deeply upsetting and deeply frustrating that we're led by mush.
691.68 701.68 GEORGIE:  We need a leadership to get our self together, to get our food sorted, and we just can't live in this sort of hand-to-mouth, piecemeal way.
702.68 705.68 GEORGIE:  More thought needs to be going into this for sure.

706.68 709.68 HOST:   Lauren and Beth call an emergency meeting.
LAUREN BETH AND GEORGIE WANT A LEADER, JAMIE, CHAVALA AND BELINDA DO NOT
JULIE STARTS CRYING
710.68 714.68 LAUREN:  We're working as a democracy, and things are pretty positive.
714.68 717.68 LAUREN:  Something has gone wrong somewhere.
717.68 719.68 JAMIE:  What do you think has gone wrong?
719.68 721.68 LAUREN:  We're literally starved.
722.68 727.68 LAUREN:  The group feels fragmented, and that we're not a unit.
727.68 729.68 BETH:  I don't know how that fire's managed to keep going.
729.68 733.68 BETH:  It's literally by luck and coincidence that we keep rocking up, going, oh, fuck the fire.
733.68 735.68 BETH:  It's literally just about to go out.
735.68 738.68 BETH:  And, oh, God, I've just got that job of water.
738.68 744.68 BETH:  You know, it's basically lack of structure, because then we have lack of food, and it's kind of a knock-on effect.
744.68 752.68 GEORGIE: I think, personally, we need to decide on a leader to set out what is needed and a plan of action.
752.68 756.68 CHAVALA: I can hear you're really passionate, Georgie, and I totally get it.
756.68 761.68 CHAVALA: But I think, for me, we collaboratively lead the group.
761.68 769.68 GEORGIE: CHAVALA, that system is not working, because we've done that, and I think we're stumbling from one day to the next, and now we're in crises.
769.68 770.68 BELINDA: I'm with CHAVALA here.
770.68 772.68 BELINDA: Why is it necessary to have the leader?
772.68 774.68 GEORGIE: Because the leader knows where everything is.
774.68 778.68 GEORGIE: The leader will lead you and go, right, OK, these are the priorities.
778.68 784.68 JAMIE:  Why should I let somebody boss me about and tell me what to do?
784.68 786.68 JAMIE:  I'll do what I want to do.
786.68 792.68 LAUREN:  You cannot stand there and go, I'm going to do what I want to do, and if someone's telling me what to do, I'm not going to do it.
792.68 793.68 GEORGIE:  But we all need to come together.
793.68 794.68 JAMIE:  Exactly.
794.68 795.68 JAMIE:  It's not an argument.
795.68 796.68 LAUREN:  It's not an argument, Jamie.
796.68 799.68 JAMIE:  This is what happens when you try and elect leaders.
JULIE: I DIDN’T WANT US TO START FIGHTING
810.68 812.68 JULIE This is what I didn't want.

JULIE COMFORTED BY GEORGINA AND CHAVALA, BELINDA

812.68 817.68 HOST: Trying to improve their destructive group dynamic is important for the women.
817.68 822.68 HOST:  Now they've turned on each other, they've pushed their very survival back into jeopardy.
822.68 826.68 HOST:  And without decisive leadership, they won't make it to the end.

826.68 828.68 JULIE:  I'm so torn.
828.68 829.68 CHAVALA:  I'm torn.
829.68 835.68 LAUREN:  I think the fact that we're so torn means that there isn't ever going to be a leader.

835.68 845.68 CHAVALA: I want a double cheeseburger with extra cheese, extra gherkins, onions, a little bit of lettuce, tomato, just for good measure.
845.68 847.68 HOST:   It's the final week on the island.
847.68 850.68 HOST:   Food is scarce and the women are starving.
851.68 852.68 BEKI:  Age.
852.68 853.68 BEKI:  Don't talk about food.
853.68 855.68 BEKI:  What do we... What's the new rule we say?
855.68 856.68 BEKI:  Penis, penis, penis.
856.68 859.68 BEKI:  Penis, penis, penis. Just say that instead.
859.68 860.68 BEKI:  It'll stop you thinking about it.

860.68 862.68 CHAVALA: That's why I'm down today.
862.68 863.68 CHAVALA: I'm craving food.
863.68 865.68 BEKI:  Penis.
865.68 874.68 BEKI:  We're in a really shit situation and there has to be someone that's ballsy enough to grab the ball by the horns and go, do you know what, guys, this is what we need to do.

881.68 884.68 HOST:   A violent storm is pummelling the island.

887.68 889.68 GEORGIE: Is Jamie still out there?
889.68 892.68 FI: Yeah, she's having some time now.
892.68 898.68 HOST:   Most of the women are sheltering under the fire canopy, but one of them has removed herself from the group.
JAMIE DISTANCED HERSELF FROM THE GROUP
898.68 901.68 GEORGIE: Jamie's still toughing it out on the beach.

902.68 904.68 BELINDA: Sopping wet, it is.
904.68 906.68 BELINDA: Isn't that the definition of sexy?
910.68 913.68 HOST: It's been a broken night's sleep, lying on the wet ground.
913.68 915.68 JAMIE:  Oh, my God, I look like the elephant man
915.68 917.68 CHAVALA:   It's really not that bad.
918.68 921.68 HOST:   The rain has brought an onslaught of insect attacks.
921.68 924.68 JAMIE: Do not want to be on camera to see if it's a good thing.
924.68 926.68 JAMIE:   If any films me ill take off
926.68 929.68 BETH:   The insect bites are driving around the fucking bend.
929.68 932.68 BETH: I'd like to punch each fly in the nose.
932.68 937.68 LAUREN:  We had something the fuck off biting us last night, and I had bites all over my ass.
937.68 939.68 LAUREN:  Bloody ridiculous.
941.68 943.68 GEORGIE:  Basically get rid of all this shit on the roof.
943.68 947.68 HOST:  Painful, itchy bites aren't their only problem.
947.68 949.68 GEORGIE:  I mean, there literally is a twig on the roof.
949.68 951.68 GEORGIE:  I mean, it's a twig on the roof.
951.68 953.68 HOST:   It's a twig on the roof.
953.68 955.68 HOST:   It's their only problem.
955.68 958.68 GEORGIE I mean, there literally is a twig holding that fucking lot up.
958.68 961.68 HOST:   The storm has wreaked havoc in camp.
961.68 963.68 GEORGIE:   That don't look good, honey.
963.68 969.68 HOST:   The desperate hunt for food has to be put on hold as the canopy protecting the fire is on the verge of collapse.
969.68 972.68 FI: It's that big crack there running along the middle of it.

972.68 974.68 GEORGIE: Yeah.
974.68 976.68 CHAVALA: How are you getting on?
976.68 978.68 GEORGIE: Slow.
978.68 980.68 GEORGIE: But it's better than what we've got, right?
980.68 981.68 GEORGIE:   Which is zero right now.
981.68 987.68 HOST:   For them from insects and rain, Fi and Georgie have decided to build a raised bed with a roof.
988.68 993.68 BEKI: It's a very busy camp today to make sure we have a good shelter for us.
993.68 995.68 BEKI: And our fire is as dry as a bone.
995.68 997.68 BEKI: All hands on deck.
997.68 999.68 GEORGIE: Down, down, down, down, down, down there.
999.68 1001.68 GEORGIE: That's it, you got it.
1005.68 1007.68 GEORGIE: Shall I go that end and push?
1007.68 1008.68 None  Yeah.
1008.68 1010.68 GEORGIE: Where's everybody gone?
1010.68 1011.68 SPEAKER_02  I think I'll be in bit.
1011.68 1013.68 FI:  Belinda and Jamie are having a lie down.

1014.68 1020.68 JAMIE:  It's just got too serious and I know we've got jobs to do, but why is there so much pressure all of a sudden?

1020.68 1022.68 GEORGIE:  Guys, we haven't finished! To Julie and Belinda
1022.68 1024.68 JAMIE: I know we're not finished.
1024.68 1026.68 JAMIE:  I was actually just having a little bit of a race.
1026.68 1027.68 JAMIE:  Ah.
1027.68 1029.68 JAMIE: So give me a break, please.
1029.68 1031.68 GEORGIE: I'm not saying that. I'm just saying you haven't finished, that's all.
1031.68 1032.68 JAMIE: Right.
1032.68 1034.68 JAMIE: Just whack them all on now.
1036.68 1037.68 JAMIE cus ive had enough.
1037.68 1038.68 SPEAKER_04  Down.

1052.68 1054.68 GEORGIE:  going to kill myself with these fucking boxes.

1054.68 1057.68 HOST:   While the rest of the group toil away on the bed shelter.
1060.68 1063.68 HOST:   Jamie and Belinda decide to take the afternoon off.

Beth is not happy about this
1067.68 1078.68 BETH:  I kind of feel a little bit like, you know when someone comes into your house and takes a massive shit in your toilet, eats all your food, messes your house and then leaves and goes, bye now!
1081.68 1090.68 LAUREN:  We have been upset and tired and angry and so there's only so long that those things can go on for until you have to do something.
1090.68 1091.68 LAUREN:  So we have to change it.
1091.68 1093.68 LAUREN:  If we're not happy, then do something about it.
LAUREN AND BETH CALL AN ELECTION
1094.68 1096.68 HOST:   Beth and Lauren take decisive action.
1096.68 1097.68 HOST:   They call an election.
1099.68 1100.68 CHAVALA: Jamie!
1101.68 1102.68 JAMIE: Hi!
1102.68 1103.68 JAMIE: Hello!
1103.68 1104.68 CHAVALA: We're having a meeting.

1107.68 1110.68 BEKI:  I find Jamie so unpredictable.
1110.68 1114.68 BEKI: I don't know if she's going to shrug it off and just say, oh, do you know what, whatever.
1114.68 1116.68 BEKI: Or if she's going to kick off about it.

1117.68 1122.68 HOST:   All the great expeditions have always had a leader, whether it's Amazon, Scott or Shackerton.
1122.68 1125.68 HOST:   But resistance to leadership is not uncommon.

1127.68 1136.68 CHAVALA: We've called this meeting today because not much has changed and most people still want a leader.
1137.68 1145.68 CHAVALA: If anybody would like to go for leadership, please make yourself be known.
1150.68 1151.68 LAUREN: Me and Beth.
1151.68 1153.68 JAMIE I'm confused, to be honest.
1153.68 1155.68 JAMIE What's so bad?
1156.68 1160.    LAUREN:  We need a leader so everyone knows exactly what they're doing.
1160.68 1162.68 JAMIE:  You know my feelings on the leadership.
1162.68 1164.68 JAMIE:  Not a happy about, that...
1165.68 1173.68  LAUREN: Our whole experience has been amazing and so I just want to end with success and it means a lot, I think, to show that we never gave up.
1173.68 1174.68 CHAVALA: Yeah.
1174.68 1176.68 CHAVALA: I so get you.
1176.68 1179.68 CHAVALA: I so want bear to come and we're going to be there.
1179.68 1184.68 CHAVALA: I so want there to come and look at our camp and think, crikey, those girls were good.
1184.68 1186.68 GEORGIE: Do we need to take a vote?
1186.68 1191.68 BELINDA: I think we should just go forward a bit because you're the only people who want to do it.
1191.68 1193.68 GEORGIE  You're happy to go with Beth and Lauren.
1193.68 1195.68 GEORGIE:  Are people happy with that?
1199.68 1200.68 GEORGIE:  Jamie?
1200.68 1201.68 JAMIE: Yeah.
LAUREN AND BETH ELECTED AS LEADERS


1203.68 1206.68 HOST:   Lauren and Beth are going to run the leadership jointly.

1210.68 1212.68 GEORGIE: After all of that, well done.
1212.68 1213.68 BETH: Thank you.
1213.68 1214.68 GEORGIE: Be proud of yourselves.
1214.68 1215.68 BETH: Yeah.

1217.68 1224.68 LAUREN: I was so nervous leading up to her, just seeing, oh, my God, how is this going to be taken, especially after the other day?
1224.68 1227.68 LAUREN:  But actually, it seems pretty positive.

1231.68 1233.68 JULIE:  We need to just straighten out this end.
1233.68 1237.68 HOST:   The new leader's first priority is to feed everyone.
1237.68 1242.68 BETH:  We are now going to move the nets basically at a different angle in the sea.
1242.68 1244.68 BETH:  So hopefully we can get a fish.
1247.68 1250.68 HOST:   Together, the women have untangled the vital fishing net.
1250.68 1252.68 JULIE: OK. Keep it.
1252.68 1255.68 HOST:   They're now determined to finally land a big catch.

1259.68 1260.68 CHAVALA: The net's great.
1260.68 1261.68 CHAVALA: I think, at least we're trying.
1261.68 1263.68 CHAVALA: I think God loves to try it.

1264.68 1269.68 BELINDA: I think that Jamie just feeling undervalued, that sort of thing.
1269.68 1276.68 HOST:   With all 10 women needed to tackle a food crisis, Lauren has to bring Jamie back into the fold.
1276.68 1280.68 LAUREN: We need every single one of those girls in the group to get through this.
1280.68 1288.68 LAUREN: I know what it feels like to fail at something that you give your all to, and I'm not prepared to go through that again.

1289.68 1293.68 LAUREN: I'd probably picture myself as a bit of a young leader.
1293.68 1296.68 LAUREN: In 2013, I decided to row across the Atlantic,
1296.68 1306.68 LAUREN:  but the boat cap sized, I split my head open. The failure of the rows left a huge void in my life, and then I thought, yeah, the island's definitely something I want to do.
1306.68 1309.68 LAUREN:  This is definitely how I'm going to get it back.
1309.68 1313.68  LAUREN: I always give my everything to whatever challenge I set myself.
1313.68 1318.68 LAUREN:  So when I fail, I feel that in a big way.

1319.68 1322.68  LAUREN:  Jay? Jamie?
1322.68 1325.68 LAUREN:  So I just want to clear the air.
1325.68 1333.68 LAUREN: I was feeling like you weren't helping out, but what I should have done, absolutely what I should have done is come and talk to you about it.
1333.68 1346.68 JAMIE:  I remember I woke up with them bites all over my face, and that put me in a sort of vicious cycle where I was like, just not enjoying being here, and not motivated to do anything.
1346.68 1349.68 LAUREN: Get more involved if you want to do stuff.
1349.68 1353.68 JAMIE: I do sometimes feel like I can't be arsed.
LAUREN AND JAMIE HUG IT OUT

1358.68 1368.68 JAMIE:  I probably come across selfish, but I hope that they can understand that I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings.

1371.68 1377.68 JAMIE: I don't want to leave this island feeling sour and BITTER.

1379.68 1382.68 LAUREN: I think we're here.
FI: yeah
1382.68 1384.68 LAUREN: So this is our beach.
1384.68 1388.68 HOST:  Lauren's plan now is to search for food beyond the confines of their beach.
1388.68 1391.68 JAMIE:  We go up that track until we hit that middle path.
1391.68 1392.68 JAMIE:  Correct.
1392.68 1396.68 JAMIE:  Then we go down with the sea always on our left-hand side.
1396.68 1400.68 HOST:   She leads a hunting party deep into the jungle.

1400.68 1401.68 SPEAKER_03  See you later.
1401.68 1403.68 HOST:   Along the coast...
1403.68 1408.68 JAMIE: My nail was stuck in this fucking gooey bat.
1408.68 1414.68 HOST:   Vegetarian Jamie has volunteered to scavenge for limpets to feed the rest of the group.
1414.68 1417.68 JAMIE: Oh, my God. Honestly, what is that?

1422.68 1423.68 BEKI:  Anything?
1423.68 1425.68 LAUREN:  Does that look rotten to you?
1425.68 1428.68 BEKI: Yeah, yeah, an animal's been at it.

1429.68 1431.68 BELINDA: You've got snails the size of your head.
1431.68 1432.68 BELINDA: Whoo-hoo!
1432.68 1434.68 SPEAKER_03  Shut the front door.
1434.68 1436.68 SPEAKER_03  Wow!
1436.68 1440.68 HOST:   The women on the other side of the island are still on the hunt for yucca.

1441.68 1446.68 BEKI: It would really suck to have come all of this way and not find yucca.
1449.68 1452.68 BETH:  Guys, I've just found a tin of something.
1452.68 1453.68 JULIE:  Whoa!
1453.68 1454.68 JULIE:  Oh, my God.

1461.68 1464.68 BEKI:  That was going to make everyone super happy.

1468.68 1472.68 BETH:  We found two tins of baked beans.
1472.68 1474.68 GEORGIE:  You found beans.
1475.68 1481.68 HOST:   The rusty tins are packed with protein and sugar and may have been left by a hunting party from another island.
1481.68 1483.68 HOST:   It's a lucky find.
1483.68 1487.68 BETH:  Tonight, my dear, we have got baked beans.
1487.68 1489.68 BETH: I can't wait.
1489.68 1491.68 BETH: I've got to wait to eat it.

2421.68 2422.68 CHAVALA:  Thank you.

2428.68 2429.68 SPEAKER_02  And they're just generally hanging out.

2516.68 2520.68 SPEAKER_03  We have shown the world that women can achieve anything.
2522.68 2528.68 JAMIE:  What I've learned is I need to appreciate what I've got right now and not strive to look for other better things.
2528.68 2530.68 JAMIE:  I think it's made more content.
2532.68 2534.68 JAMIE:  I've decided that I'm OK.
2535.68 2537.68 JAMIE:  I'm such a bad person.
